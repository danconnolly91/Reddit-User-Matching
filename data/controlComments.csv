22,Raykuu,1487964983.0,de63xit,"I pulled Sengoku one year ago and he's still one of my most used captains. Although he doesn't have a 100% clear rate, he's simply amazing for speedrunning fornights and story islands, due to his -2 Cdr(-4 with 2x Goku) if you have to stall for specials, and he also makes Int raids look like a piece of cake.

The characters which fit well in Goku teams are:

* **Str**: Arlong(beatstick), Young Arlong(less Atk than the other version but special way more useful + 1 socket more), Alvida(mostly for forests), Halloween Franky(decent stats, gives him a matching orb and allows you to swap orbs once, 3 sockets), Gear 2 Luffy(beatstick, 3 sockets),
Mr. 1(decent stats, special on a low cd), Calgara(high Atk, class-boosting special low cd)

* **Dex**: Doffy(I used him for raids like Aokiji, higher damage output than Fortnight Coby if you have another PSY-Beatstick like Story Enel), Biker Smoker(high stats, decent special, 3 sockets), Perona(forests), Ashura Zoro(beatstick, 3 sockets), Kimono Zoro(decent stats, useful special if you lack Anti-lock sockets), Miss Doublefinger(for speedruns)

* **Qck**: Beast Lucci, Fortnight Kaku(for speedruns), Halloween Zoro(delayer with decent stats), Ganfor(decent stats, boosts Atk of Captains for 2 turns, max cd:14), Prison Croc(decent stats, boosts Atk of Strikers by 1.5x and poisons enemies, max cd: 14), Fortnight Ivankov(orb-manipulator)

* **Psy**: GPU, Impact Ussop, Gild Tesoro, Timeskip Franky!!!(2x orb-booster for PSY, 4 sockets), Story Enel(high Atk, type-boosting special w/ fixed damage), Momonga(decent stats, his special also boosts Goku), Fortnight Coby(for speedruns), T-bone(decent stats, useful special but situational, 3 sockets)

* **Int**: Breed!!!(amazing for a fortnight unit, good special+high stats, for forests), V1 Robin, Kimono Nami or Mirage Tempo Nami(Aokiji forest), Noland(for speedruns), Prison Mr.1(beatstick)

Firstly you should try to clear the Beard forest by using:

* a F2P Slasher Team: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFt6-q6_daU

* or a Fuji + Shiki Team: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7532GRigmQ

After you've maganed to get the Moby Dick, you could try to beat the Jimbei forest by using 2x Sengoku: 

* https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceTC/comments/5hhqvj/jimbei_forest_stalling_overview_and_sengoku/

and the Aokiji forest by using 2x Sengoku:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceTC/comments/4ylv4p/forest_of_training_pheasant_sengoku_team_guide/

Some of these characters are hard to max due to their horrible drop rate(e.g. Breed), so don't get discouraged if you can't max them in one go. Good luck! :D

62,HolishGuy,1532727218.0,e35jwvc,"I really just winged this and it was my first crack. Was delicious though so I definitely recommend. 

Ingredients:

1 1/2 large cauliflower 

250g bacon

2 tbs butter

Minced garlic to taste (I used a heaped tea spoon)

1 - 1.5 cup Thick cooking cream 

150g Cream cheese

2 cup mozzarella 

100g sharp parmesan


I didn't do a shop for this. There would probably be better cheeses but j used what I had and it was really good. 

Preheat oven to 185c

1. Roughly chop cauliflower, bring a pot of water to boil and add the cauliflower (8 minutes) then drain.

2. Chop bacon into small pieces and fry to desired crispness and set aside

3. Add butter and garlic to a medium sized pot and fry for a few minutes on high heat, then add cream

4. Bring the cream to boil and then reduce heat to simmer for a few minutes to thicken. 

5. Added mozzarella and cream cheese, stirring occasionally (8-12 minutes) 

6. Applied baking paper to a casserole dish (or deep tray if you're like me) and lightly oil. Spread the cauliflower around, then pour the cheese sauce. Top with the parmesan, bacon and salt and pepper to taste. 

7. Cover with foil and leave in oven for 30-40 minutes. I was lazy but you could put it under the broiler/grill with the foil off for a few minutes at the end to golden up the cheese 

First time writing up a recipe but yeah overall it's a super easy and delicious side that will probably take me a week to eat (girlfriend is vegan..)

I ate about 1/5th of this and it was a lot. Didn't count calories because was doing omad and didn't really need to. I think next time I'm going to go 65/35 cauliflower/broccoli to see how that is.

Edit: I know most people on keto will shun this but I used light cream/cream cheese in this as it's what I had and it really did taste great. Definitely doesn't need as much cheese as I used either so if you're trying to find other ways to have it without so many calories just use less. ",ketorecipes,1,t3_92ggpm,True

If you were more asking about specific types of lifting or excersise, I would recommend starting off with three days a week with a rest day in between each. One day for legs (squats/leg press/leg curls etc) one day for core/back (deadlifts, planking, row machine,  shoulder shrugs) And finally chest/arms be it bench presses/dumb bells/machines (i prefer free weights and find machines gimmicky but hey it's up to you).

Edit for anyone who needs a professional email address, personally I find any combination of your first, middle, last names, initials, and birthdate are all acceptable. In fact any numbers but 420, 69, etc. And 123 is fine. It’s absolutely worth having a very bland email for anything where you don’t want your email to make a big impression, I.e legal things, professional things, and emailing your grandma because she doesn’t like text. Don’t email your grandma from your bootyslayer email.

Edit 2, as some have mentioned below 666 is also not a great number to add. And if your birthdate happens to be a number on this list, pay special attention to how you format it. For instance if your birthday is 420, formate that along with the year as something like 042099. The person looking at your application will probably understand, and not think it’s a joke.

Edit 3. I did a bad job typing that. I meant any number but 420, 69. (And as somebody added 666) And 123 is fine. I typed that first thing when I woke up with no coffee. Random numbers are okay. 123 is okay.",AskReddit,14111,t3_iy03a0,False

My interpretation of Job is that it is an exploration of what it means to “fear God”, a phrase I heard in church a lot growing up and never really understood.  

Basically, arguing that Job demonstrates that God is not good is kind of besides the point, although it is certainly correct.  What the book of Job says is that God is first and foremost all-powerful and works in “mysterious ways”.  We cannot know his motives (he sure never tells Job about his bet with Satan), nor can we expect to understand them.  

As a human with typical human values, yes, God treats Job like a dick.  Replace god with a business executive, make Job a loyal factory worker, and Job could sue for a lot of money.  Any other power dynamic we are familiar with makes God look like a vainglorious manipulative scum bag.  

But if God is all-powerful, or at least if you entertain this notion while considering the book of Job, you realize Job is completely at his mercy.  He asks the same question everyone asks at least once (and for many of us, quite often): why?  And god appears as a tornado and says, “okay, put up your dukes.  By the way, I can kick the ass of leviathan and the minotaur like it’s nothing at all.  I’m God, you’re a human, you don’t get to ask me ‘why’.”  And that’s more than the rest of us ever get.  

Basically, God is God and we are wee little humans.  Sometimes he bestows us with good times, sometimes bad, but we cannot and will not ever know why.  That’s the power dynamic, like it or not.  And hey-life is not *all* bad.  Or at least it can always be worse.",changemyview,1,t3_p1pmdu,False

If you have a police scanner, just about every single day when the weather allows, you will hear police radioing in about a group of dirt bikes and/or ATVs causing some kind of scene somewhere in Pittsburgh with total disregard for the safety of others, even the presence of others, traffic lights, one-way-streets, etc.  

Every single time, and I mean \*every\* single time, the cops eventually say there's nothing they can do.  One cop tried to detain two dirt bikers in Wilkinsburg; they flipped him off and drove away.  He didn't even pursue.

Here's the thing: dirt bikes and ATVs are not ""street legal"", so they do not have license plates.  Whoever's riding them is wearing a full enclosure helmet, which means no description.  And they are really good at running from the cops because they have no problem with evading traffic by going up on a sidewalk, driving through a red light in a busy intersection, etc.  

The cops basically can't pursue, both because of logistics (cop car size and maneuverability vs that of a motorbike) ad because doing so would be extremely dangerous for anyone else that happens to be on the road.  Or for the dirt bikers themselves...I would imagine what they're doing is a misdemeanor, and if a cop is chasing one of them at 60 mph and the dirt biker crashes and sustains serious injury or dies, that is a hard one to justify.

What the OP might be referring to is this country's ""warrior"" approach to policing.  From when cops trainees, it is purposefully instilled in them that their job means ""fighting"", fighting a ""war"", that this is a hostile world where death is a constant threat, etc.  Look at police culture from this perspective and you start to see just how ingrained this world view truly is in the police force.  The war on drugs, the war on crime...this is not just vapid semantics.  This is purposeful, loaded language, and it is used with intent.  This is deeply problematic for a ton of reasons.  

Also, elsewhere you ask OP for statistics.  I would like to point out that those are very hard to come by regarding this stuff because the **police basically do not release them**.  And, when they do, it is dramatically underreported.  Our best source of fatal police shooting statistics is news stories.  We do not have data on the overall use of force by police.

Before you get your chow, the breeder should be having them properly socialized for at least two months.  This is the crucial period for familiarizing chows with people.

As for friendships...making friends only gets harder as you grow older, but you're in college and definitely still in a great position to change your social circle.  Given the fact that your former friends ditched you for someone who cheated on you,  I'd think it's high time you did so.  

Join a club, start going to new campus activities, find a new hobby, etc.

If they don't like it, they aren't in the band.  Simple as that.  

As for getting people to take it seriously...I always make my ambitions very clear the first time I meet a potential band mate.  Hell, I list my ambitions in the ads I post looking for them.  

Don't forget, though, that you're dealing with musicians;  some are very hard working and tremendously disciplined (if they've ever gone to a conservatory or aspire to do so, they absolutely have to be), and some are the absolute flakiest, most unreliable and lazy people who have ever lived.  More often than not, I'll meet people who are a mixed bag;  they've got some major pluses and major negatives, and I have to determine if I can deal with the latter in exchange for the former.  It's like a sexless harem.  It's not easy.  

The wall I run into is that I'll find perfectly legit band members who nevertheless absolutely cannot tour.  Which makes sense;  not many jobs let you just dip out for a months.  

Oh and there's another wall:  drummer/bassist supply and demand.  There are so few drummers and bassists in my area that most of them are in, like, four active bands.  And frequently they can be prima donnas because they feel irreplaceable.  Which, to some extent, they are.  

Trying to maintain a band gives one appreciation for bands that have somehow kept the same members for twenty years:  U2, Radiohead, Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, etc.  It's truly like winning the lottery.  Three or more times in a row.

To some extent they brought it on themselves;  they're very boldly goofy (case in point: the band name), and I think that's the first impression people get of them.  Strip away the goofy, however, and I think they're one of the best ""alt/indie rock"" bands of the last 20+ years.  

Their stylistic breadth is second to none.  Listen to a song like Piss up a Rope (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7M3EEHYkJ0), which is an unabashed country music pastiche parody, and then check out a song like Mutilated Lips (https://youtu.be/mzIHkFJnLbc).

Came out in 1977; the band was a duo, their sound consisting of haunting baritone vocals over highly repetitive and very minimalistic drum machine and synth lines.  They were the godfathers of techno, new wave, industrial, and arguably even indie rock (though I myself think that's a bit tenuous).  Listen to their first two albums now and they sound just as fresh and relevant and vital as any contemporary release.  Timeless is a huge cliche, but it's absolutely applicable with regards to Suicide.

Speaking of whether 'dance electronica' somehow denigrates quality lyricism, I'd actually argue that Blue Monday is a prime example of the extent to which this doesn't have to be true.  I'd read that Blue Monday is actually about being gay, and the persecution one can face as  a consequence.

I thought it would be a great opportunity to listen to the entire Elliott Smith discography in chronological order.  I was probably at the height of my ES fandom (all those albums are classics, with nary a bad song on just about any of them); it seemed like a great idea.  

Turns out it wasn't.  Elliott Smith's music isn't overtly dark and depressing (he's not Joy Division, for instance), but it has a way of sneaking up on you.  Especially when you're driving in the snow for hours at a time listening to nothing but.  

I had to stop just about midway through Figure 8.  I was finding it harder and harder to resist driving into oncoming traffic. 

I mention all this because of the subjects you mentioned-loneliness, lack of direction.  This kind of subject matter goes right through Elliott Smith land.  And go ahead, make a stop.

HTTT is my favorite collection of Radiohead songs.  I listened to them all the time during the tour they did to road test them prior to recording and eagerly anticipated the album release.  And I have to say I was let down.  Songs like There, There, Scatterbrain and Sit Down Stand Up were far better live; more aggressive, more starkly dynamic.  There, There's three-drum punch had the life sucked out of it for the album, and I still prefer having both Phil and Ed doubling the backing vocals rather than having Ed do the ""AHH-ahhh"" thing.  Even though it makes sense in terms of the dynamics, I think I still prefer having the outro riff come in as soon as Thom Yorke wails 'There, There!' after the second refrain.    

Sit Down. Stand Up.  used to end with Yorke screaming 'the raindrops' like a madman; the album version actually gets rather subdued during this portion of the song, which had a rather castrating effect.  

The idea behind the album's recording, if memory serves, was to do it live in-studio with minimal overdubs and yet there seems to have been a concerted effort to make everything sound kind of spooky and subdued.  I think this defeats the original concept, and makes the album sound a bit uncertain, to be honest.  ",radiohead,1,t3_2wjwn3,False

You mention the extent to which sufferers of depression come to love their depression, even becoming protective of it.  I think this is the crux of depression, addiction and I suspect other mental illnesses as well: the sufferer very often undermines their own efforts as a consequence of their fear of a life without depression.  Worse yet, it seems that this is largely subconscious.  Because as talk acknowledge, it's weird;  who could like depression?  Who could like unhappiness?

It's often said that happiness is the greatest motivating human factor.  I disagree.  Comfort and familiarity trumps happiness.  Often the latter is synonymous with the former, but not always.  Not with depression.  As you mention,  there are upsides to depression; people tend to tread cautiously around the depressed, and can be very forgiving of egregious behavior that wouldn't be otherwise tolerated.  Stay like this for long enough, and the process of genuinely ""getting better"" depends on a revision of one's self-concept that can be very harrowing and unpleasant.  One goes from having some significant degree of a perpetual-victim attitude to acknowledging disturbing tendencies towards self-centeredness.  Not an easy thing to do, especially when it's impossible to know where one's direct agency ends with regards to depression.  

It's like treating a patient for a broken leg that inexplicably doesn't heal for months and months.  Eventually it turns out that several times a week the patient sleepwalks out to the driveway and kicks a brick wall with their broken foot for ten minutes.

1930,summerlungs,1417709837.0,cml0vgw,"what did you like about it?  

don't get me wrong, it was eminently readable; Stephen King's gift for narrative and dialogue is unerring.  Even his worst books are still worth reading because of this, IMO.  

I know how important of a book Dream Catcher truly was for him.  It was the first thing he wrote after the accident, he was in tremendous pain, and the novel is imbued with the state of mind from which it was birthed.  Context aside, however, it's way more formulaic and uncertain than just about anything else he's written.  In Bag of Bones (I think), the main character talks about the two kinds of novels he writes.  The first kind are basically sudden bursts of inspiration, and they basically come out fully-formed; all that's left to do is to stitch it together.  The second kind are ""What Then?""'s...he conceives of a character or characters, and then conceives of a situation they're in. Then he asks, ""What then?""  What happens next?  He keeps doing so until the novel is eventually finished.  

Dream Catcher suggests that this approach to writing is derived from King's own experience.  What's more, Dream Catcher definitely seems to be a ""What If?"" book.  Unfortunately, it never transcends the ""what if?""'s, in my opinion.  It just kind of...proceeds.  There's no flow, no sense of a larger concept at work.  And I get it;  this wasn't King's primary concern.  He needed to get the fucking thing done just to prove to himself that he could still finish a novel.  Hell, the last chapter of the novel basically functions as its summation in the interest of clarifying what the hell the whole thing was even about.  

I don't begrudge him for writing it.  He went through hell, and he's allowed to do what he had to do in order to keep writing quality material.  I just don't think this book stands up based on its own merits.  but I could be wrong; I'd love to read a contrary opinion.",horror,1,t1_cmktou5,False

1932,summerlungs,1417708541.0,cml0700,"I'm rather like you;  I'm a chronic depressive, and watching bad shit happen to people gives me a thrill.  I like having my world view validated.  For me, though, I think horror films are preferable to real life. 

Consider the classic slasher film, like Nightmare on Elm Street.  The kids in those movies have one concern:  Freddy Krueger.  If they can manage to defeat him or otherwise survive him, life will be lived happily ever after.  To the best of my recollection, no one in these films is ever depressed before Freddy comes along,  existence is beatific, and concerns are trivial.  Even in Dream Warriors, which focused on kids in a psych ward, one doesn't see very much in the way of the grim realities of mental illness.   If I am remembering correctly, in all the Freddy films, there's never once been a kid who said, ""You know what?  Life fucking sucks.  What do I get to look forward to if I survive this situation?  A lifetime of PTSD, i.e. yet another brutal struggle, as well as whatever other awful shit might come my way?  Hell with that, I'm taking a nap.  Freddy, let's do this thing"".  

When I think of my experience of real life in comparison, things are far less black and white.  I don't have a Freddy Krueger, I don't have an obvious danger that can be avoided in any comprehensible way.  I've learned that life can be worse than death no matter what one does.  If I suddenly had to avoid sleep for fear of a violent death, maybe the myriad mundane atrocities would be smoothed out by the sudden onset of a perceived need to live a life that's now very much in jeopardy.  Or maybe Freddy could have actually killed my ass seventeen years ago, thus sparing me the nightmare of everything that's happened since.  

Yes, I am being very dramatic here.  I'm exaggerating to make a point.  But it's less of an exaggeration than I'd like to admit.  I like the idea of a monster I didn't create.  I like the idea of a monster I can see and know and understand.  I like the idea of a fate without the delusion that I can do very much to escape it.  If there's a monster in my life, it's me.  I daresay even Freddy Krueger is more readily escapable.

Hell, some people consider looking at pornography to be cheating.  While I don't personally agree that it is, I understand their logic.  

Let me ask you something:  even if he has not acted on it, even if you can believe him if he says so, can you trust that he won't act on it in the future?  And can you believe him if he swears he never will?  He might say this and genuinely mean it, too; behold the specter of self-deception.  Have you ever struggled with a want?  I have.  It sucks, and I always got tired before my desire even so much as broke a sweat.  

I wouldn't call this snooping, either;  people check browser histories all the time for all sorts of reasons.  Sometimes I want to remember what web page I was visiting when I read something that stuck with me.  Every time I look it up, I'm also forced to acknowledge just how much pornography I consume on a daily basis.  

Ask him what's going on.  Don't do so in an accusatory tone;  you may be justified in doing so, but it virtually guarantees a negative outcome.  No one likes to be busted;  it makes us feel acutely weak and vulnerable.  If you want to find a way to get through this situation, it behooves you to broach the subject gently.  The gravity of the situation speaks for itself; it does not need to be shouted, you know? 

If he tries to turn it around on you, if he can't admit wrongdoing and guilt,  if he doesn't acknowledge the extent to which this is both hurtful and disrespectful towards you, give him some physical space.  Go do something nice for yourself and give him time to think.  If he's still acting the same way after,  you may have a very difficult decision to make.  

You also shouldn't do all the work here, either.  He created the problem, he needs to make an effort to rectify it.  You have to get your own back; you have to stick up for yourself.

It's sort of the ultimate suspension of disbelief;  it's one thing to get an audience to forget they're watching actors portraying characters.  Actually getting an audience to forget they're sitting safe and sound in a movie theater or in front of a TV/laptop, managing to transcend reality to the extent of evoking such a primal response that we are hard-wired to not experience very often because of just how necessary it is to our survival?  That's the hardest thing to do in cinema.  Love, excitement, arousal, laughter...these are enjoyable emotions.  We want to feel these things.  Movies that attempt to convey such emotions greatly benefit thusly.  Fear can be an enjoyable thing to experience, but it's an indirect kind of enjoyment, almost an after-the-fact kind of enjoyment.  It's usually the kind of thing you can't experience unless you're physically engaged in some kind of activity that simulates or even creates real danger, i.e. a roller coaster or a motorcycle ride.

Terminator 2.  It's not just the trailer, I suppose, but all the buzz surrounding the film prior to its release.  Everyone knew Arnold was the goodbye this go-round.  And I still quite liked the movie regardless.  But what could have been....

The film itself doesn't immediately reveal that Arnold is a protagonist.

Though this film sure as hell forces the fucking issue, to say the least.

My problem with it is that it's dishonest, and it doesn't live up to its true potential in a very frustrating way.  It's not an allegory for what it means to be Serbian.  That's nothing but a bullshit justification.  Maybe that's the line Spasojevic had to sell in order to get the film made, but as the viewer, I'm still expected to buy it all the same, and for Spasojevic's film I think it's ultimately detrimental.  Like Found, the film he wanted to make was about powerlessness and the cruelty of life.  A man tries to do right by his family in the only way he can, and only ends up destroying them, as well as himself.  Unfortunately the extent to which his film tries to keep up its nonsense cultural non-message obfuscates its real intended message.  He could have made it far more salient and impactful if he hadn't wasted time fucking about with its insincere Larger Issue pretensions, but he did.  It's not the film it could gave been.

1980,summerlungs,1416709022.0,cmaavcw,"I went to college in Oberlin, ohio, a small town about an hour south of Cleveland.  During my time there, I spend many an hour scouring the internet for local urban legends, that kind of thing.  I happened upon a particularly interesting one that had also occurred fairly close by, maybe half an hour to (I think) the west.  There was this place called Gore Orphanage Road, a fairly long and relatively well-know rural Ohio route.  It was named after, you guessed it, Gore Orphanage, the most unfortunately-named orphanage of all time that had naturally burned down some decades back with all the kids trapped inside.  

  Of course there were multiple refutations of this story that said it had simply closed down, but one way or the other, the building was no more and all that was left behind were a few stone ruins.  In the pictures, they looked ever-so-slightly Stonehenge-ish, covered in graffiti and creepy as fuck.  Someone had posted a warning saying that it was a favorite spot for midwestern psychopath satan worshippers to get up to all kinds of ill shit.  Or at least it had been; the ruins were now on the property of a state police outpost, and evidently the state police had a habit of greeting trespassers with a shotgun.  

  By this time I was in a band with a local heavy metal drummer.  Because of this pedigree, he had of course heard of Gore Orphanage, but had never visited himself.  And so, one chilly October night, my girlfriend, the drummer, my roommate, my bassist and I all piled into my car and headed for the Orphanage, Tool blasting through the stereo speakers. 

  It was difficult to find.  There were two Gore Orphanage Roads, and the drummer wound up not being much help because he was unfamiliar with this part of Ohio.  We drove around identical rural roads well into the night, ultimately stopping at some bar in a town called Lima to ask for directions from a sympathetic bartender with dyed black hair.  

We finally got to the place.  We had to pull off to the side of the road.  By now half of us were stoned (not me because I have adverse reactions to marijuana), and we were all more than a little disoriented due to the long, confusing drive and unfamiliar surroundings.  And we were scared because we were entering the woods in the dark in pursuit of ruins that might have been occupied by mean-spirited satan worshippers or surly shotgun-wielding cops.  

Before exiting the car, I made a point of telling everyone that I would be holding the only flashlight.  We didn't want to draw attention to ourselves, and besides, I was the lead singer, I was sober, and we'd taken my car to get there, so I was the leader.  Unfortunately this meant that I had to lead the way, and I remember being surprised at how unsettled I actually was.  

We fairly quickly made it to the stones .  And it was indeed creepy as fuck.  Someone had been there very recently; there were new-looking empty cans of beer and potato chips.  And it's exactly like what you'd expect to see in a horror movie.  Creepy stones that didn't seem to belong there.  

We all looked around for a little bit.  In the distance I could see the lights of the rangers outpost.  It was much closer than I had anticipated.  I was now primarily scared of running into heavily-armed police.  We were about to head back, but first someone made the suggestion to turn off the flashlight for a moment so as to experience the full effect of Gore Orphanage's creepy darkness.  So I did; the flashlight went off, and suddenly no one could see anything.  It was a cloudy night.  It was pitch black.  

There was a flash of light.  And then another.  One of my friends was taking pictures.    Just as I was about to ask who the fuck was taking pictures, I came the closest I've ever come to pissing myself in fear.  

A few feet away, separated from our group, a very strong flashlight blinked on.  And it was aimed right in our direction.  Everyone froze.  This was it.  We were either getting arrested or murdered.  

Then my bassist flicked his light back off.  ""Gotcha!""  I turned my flashlight on and shone it at him.  The motherfucker had brought along some kind of head lamp device that he'd been hiding in his pocket.  He had snuck away from our group once my flashlight had gone off, put the head lamp on, and proceeded to scare the fuck out of all of us.  Guy was clever. 

So yeah, we all drove back, never saw any cops or satan worshippers, but for that one second, I felt like I was a little kid in his first haunted house again.  ",horror,6,t3_2n3b5r,False

I'm not a big fan of horror comedy but my goodness what fun this film turned out to be.  Brilliant pacing, well-acted, and effortlessly funny.  This film could've had its head so far up it's own ass for being so clever, but it wasn't obnoxious for so much as a second.  ""Jesus Mary and Joseph Stalin"" for sure 

**Saw** Second time I've seen this movie now and I just don't get it.  Really horrible fucking acting on par with, like, Succubus the horror porn film except at least THAT piece of shit had a sense of humor about itself.  I'm sure I'm gonna watch all six sequels and who knows, maybe I won't hate them, but Saw just seems to be so in love with its own hubris.  What am I missing?  

**starry eyes** I don't get the love for this one.  It's really really eerily similar to **Contracted**, but with a less-compelling lead and some kinda vapid implied lofty commentary on the film industry.  Turns out some people will become bad people in order to achieve fame. No shit?  

The ending almost redeemed it, though; I like the extent to which paid homage to 80s body horror.  But no, contracted did this exact same thing far more successfully IMO.

2004,summerlungs,1416315888.0,cm5wvfr,"Does anyone remember The Witches by Nicholas Roeg from way back in 1990?  It's a horror film for children (rated PG), a genre that's been dead for longer than I can remember, but despite its target demographic and matching rating, it's very, very fucked up and remarkably dark.  

It's about a young boy whose parents die in a car wreck (which as a 7-year-old was very distressing for me,  and having it occur at the beginning of the film really lent a subtext of sorrow about the darker turns one's life can take, as well as the total powerlessness anyone has to prevent them).  He goes to live with his grand mother, and they go on vacation to some huge old Victorian hotel.  Unfortunately for the two of them, the hotel is also hosting a witch's convention.  Even more unfortunate is the witch's ultimate goal: murdering every child on earth.  

Angelica Houston plays the head witch, and she's fantastic.  The witches in this film are grotesque monstrosities who hide their true appearance beneath rubber 'people' masks.  This is revealed early on in the film when a room full of them abruptly start to pull their faces off.  Again, this is somehow a PG film.  

Also keep in mind that Roeg, this film's director, is also responsible for Don't Look Now (my personal favorite horror film), as well as the mindfuck that is The Man Who Fell to Earth.  Time has largely forgotten about him, but in his day he was absolutely on the level of Kubrick.  

What makes this film great is its in-depth depiction of powerlessness over what life can do to you.  And even though its intended audience is children (or at least that's what it claimed), this powerlessness is as true for adults as it is for kids.  I'm not going to say there's nothing about this film that's befitting of a PG film, but such a film would never ever see the light of day now, simply due to the subject matter.  It's worth a watch.

2022,summerlungs,1416006789.0,cm2sasr,"Let's say you directed ""I Spit on Your Grave"".  You're doing a press conference, and a reporter asks you to explain the meaning of the rape sequence.   

You knew the scene was going to be controversial, to say the least.  You knew this question would get asked of you, and sooner rather than later.  So, what would you say?  

You could refuse to answer the question, muttering something about not feeling compelled to explain your art.  But you're doing a press conference; you've already agreed to be questioned about your art.  And furthermore, this response is the equivalent to pleading the fifth:  it's not an admission of guilt, but it's also not exactly a refutation of the accusation.  And it damn sure guarantees that you will hear the question again and again.

I think you would argue that the scene was meant to provoke the sympathy of the audience for the female character.  The audience is meant to despise the rapists.  At its conclusion they should be rooting for their blood, thereby heightening the audience's enjoyment of Keaton's character's subsequent revenge.  

Then you'd be asked about its length.  The very mention of rape evokes a very strong reaction.  Why the need for the extreme length of the sequence?  

This is where you'd be in some hot water.  You'd probably start to sweat under the lights a bit.  Why, indeed?  Throughout the history of film, the tendency to leave certain aspects of a film up to the audience's imagination is very long and storied.  Couldn't you have accomplished the same thing much more succinctly?  And even if you absolutely *had* to show the rape, why wasn't, say, five minutes sufficient?  The rape sequence you shot is over thirty minutes long.  How do you justify it?  How would you respond?  

I think one would have to argue that the length of the rape sequence is an acknowledgement of just how long women have been oppressed by our male-dominated society.  Does it make you uncomfortable?  Good.  Most of this film's audience is male, and they've been complicit in our society's oppression of women their whole lives, whether they care to admit it, whether they are even AWARE of it, or not.  Does it make you uncomfortable?  Does it seem like it went on for too long?  Guess what:  more than a few women would say the same about the restrictions placed upon them by a male-dominated society all their lives.  

Now, I'm a male.  After having said all this, I have to be prepared to answer another question.  Actually, it's more of an accusation.  

""Bullshit.  You're saying all that because you have to.  Because you've been preparing to answer for that rape scene for months and months.  Let's face facts:  you are an entertainer.  You make a form of entertainment.  Can you expect me to believe that your desire was to make your paying audience feel intense male guilt?  They went to see a horror film.  They came for gore and violence and shock.  You're saying you mind fucked them, but really I think you gave them exactly what you think they wanted.""

Now, if I'm a female, I think it's less likely that this question gets asked, because it's easier to believe that I mean what I say about the rape sequence being a metaphor for the long history of female oppression in modern society.  Because otherwise, how could I have ever actually filmed it?  And even if the question does get asked, as a female, my position is much easier to defend.  As a man, the questions will very quickly get personal.  Because how many men are self-described feminists, let alone being inspired by such beliefs to the extent of making a film inspired by them?  I would very rapidly be defending my character; we wouldn't even be discussing my film anymore.

2037,summerlungs,1415802070.0,cm0d0jf,"What seems to be working for me:

1. Network network network.  Life is all about informal social networks, and this is no less true for the music industry.  If anything it's become even more true in recent years due to major labels being driven close to extinction.  You want to generate buzz;  the buzz generators are bloggers.  Befriend these people.  Interact with them.  When they post music, give sincere and genuine feedback.  Make them feel appreciated for what they spend a lot of time doing, and you're only gonna increase your chances of them extending the same courtesy to you.  

2. Identify your audience.  This has already been mentioned in other posts but it bears repeating.  Think of bands that play your style of music/sound similar to you.  Or at the very least find bands whose fans might enjoy your music.  Now it's time to do research;  on what social media platforms are these bands most active?  Where are their fans?  This will be most beneficial for you if you pick bands that are fairly new, because they'll be closer to where you're at.  

This leads to the next tip...

3. Take your list of bands from step two.  Try to find out how they got to where they are.  Find out their release history.  What did *they* do?  This can be tricky because google doesn't really record dates in their search listings.  You can filter results according to broad swaths of time, like 'last week', 'last month' and 'last year' but you can't search for the first time a certain song was ever mentioned on the internet, for instance.  It takes some doing to find out this information.  But the breadcrumbs are there and it's worth finding them.  Plagiarizing musical ideas is bad, but plagiarizing marketing strategies is ingenious.  

And lastly...

4. Learn to love this shit.  The social media side of being a musician can take up as much time as you're willing to invest in it.  It's also very daunting; second to none is the trepidation of coming face to face with just how over-saturated the market truly is.  It'll do your head in unless you can make it enjoyable.  You get to be a sleuth, you get to play entrepreneur, and if you turn out to be good at all this, you can even make it one hell of a side job.  Because it IS daunting and discouraging, but it can also be enormously beneficial because it will give you a renewed sense of purpose.

Music (or at least, popular 'pop' music) is about articulating emotions that can't easily be put into words.  Take a song like, say, Girl by the Beatles.

And that's sincere and unfiltered lyricism, and it's readily understood by anyone with a basic grasp of the english language, but it doesn't express the emotion.  It might cause you to relate, perhaps, but it's not an articulation of the emotion.  It's just the description.  There's a big difference there.  

So instead you have John Lennon singing, Oh, Girrllll  SSSSSSSS and it's a direct translation of the emotion.

My point is, being sincere is by no means synonymous with being a gifted lyricist and/or musician.  Though one would call a good song or lyric sincere, but at that point we're talking about different definitions of sincerity as a term.  ",indieheads,3,t1_clywkd6,True

For four years, most of my schoolmates spent an inordinate amount of time taking acid and mushrooms and listening to AC.  I was in a post-punk band, which meant we were somewhat at odds with them when it came to finding an audience.  And I tried very hard to get into AC; I love their approach to sampling, modern song composition, their bold weirdness, all of that.  But I dunno, it occurred to me at one point that their fans are basically neo-hippies.  And that's fine, I have no problem with hippies past or present.  It's just not the kind of person I am.  AC has a certain...warmth to their music that I simply cannot identify with.  Even at their weirdest, you get the sense that this is music made by a group of lifelong best friends, which I think imbues it with a certain innate positivity.

Nick Cave

one of my absolute favorite musicians bar none.  

Earlier period Nick Cave:  check out Tender Prey.  Every fucking song on it is fantastic.  One of the great albums in existence, IMO.  

Mid Period Nick Cave:  Let Love In.  Another album with nary a bad track.  Or even one less than exceptional.  

Late Period Nick Cave:  Dig Lazarus Dig or Push the Sky Away.  


Really, it's hard to go wrong with Nick Cave.  Nocturama is his worst album and it's still solidly good.  I'd advise you to avoid some of the earliest albums such as From Her to Eternity and Firstborn is Dead until you've gotten into him a bit, because they're a bit...difficult, but fantastic all the same.  

Songs to try:  (can't link from youtube because I gotta run, my apologies)

2058,summerlungs,1415632009.0,clyeuwe,"Dig!  is fantastic.  It's almost hard to believe Anton Newcombe is a real person and not some fictional paradigm of the junkie rocker enfant terrible.  

Jandek on Corwood is very good, and you don't need to enjoy or even know of Jandek's music to appreciate it.  Indeed, many might say that Jandek as a person/construct is far more compelling than the music he creates (not me though, I love the guy).  

The Devil and Daniel Johnston is great because it makes zero attempt to arrive at a happy ending.  Great portrayal of the intricacies of mental illness, and the extent to which the individual is perhaps complicit.  

I like the Screamin' Jay Hawkins documentary that can be found on youtube.  http://youtu.be/qecYcFZR6Mk  Great portrayal of a truly unique figure in the history of popular music who really got put through the music industry ringer.  

The Filth and the Fury is a great documentary on the Sex Pistols, especially when it comes to their demise.  Johnny Rotten starts to cry while talking about Sid Vicious at one point and god damnit, I just about started to cry as well.  

A recent documentary about Rowland S. Howard (guitarist/songwriter of Birthday Party, These Immortal Souls, some seminal Lydia Lunch albums and solo) was really quite good, albeit very sad.  Guy finally overcomes his demons only to succumb to long term health issues as a result of them.  RIP, one of my favorite musicians of all time.  

There's an Einsturzende Neubauten documentary called Listen with Pain that is fantastic.  EN is such a bizarre, unique and near-mythical band, and the documentary does a great job of presenting a detailed portrayal without being a total fluff piece.

Perhaps the best documentary I've ever seen, and probably the best of the music documentaries, is Song Sung Blue.  It's about Lightning & Thunder, a husband-and-wife Neil Diamond tribute act.  It's heartbreaking and also a fantastic documentation of a side of the music business that is rarely acknowledged.  Many people I think try very hard to pretend it doesn't even exist, actually.  Look:  I don't like Neil Diamond, I think he's a tool, and one does not need to not hate him to enjoy this film.  See this ASAP.

2069,summerlungs,1415410618.0,clwa4e7,"I think the end of last season also reveals just how complicated Will's feelings regarding Hannibal truly are.  This scene alludes to it (though as others have stated, even if Will wanted nothing more than to kill Hannibal he was wise to free him in this situation), but the final episode [tv spoiler] (#t ""when will calls hannibal to tell him ""they know"") addresses it directly.  Despite who Hannibal is and what Hannibal has done, Will doesn't entirely hate him.  Because here's the thing: everything Hannibal says about the extent to which he values his friendship with Will could also just as easily be said by Will himself.  During his therapy sessions, Hannibal expresses the difficulty he has in building lasting relationships with anyone; the same holds true for Will.  Hannibal feels like no one understands him (which makes sense, given the whole serial killer/cannibal thing, but I digress); Will feels the same way.  Regardless of what Hannibal is and what he has done to Will, he nevertheless recognizes that Hannibal does both truly understand him and genuinely like him; it's human nature to want someone like this in one's life.    

Furthermore, after a certain point, Hannibal doesn't have a hidden agenda with Will.  As much as Jack might tell Will that he is bedrock and can be relied upon when Will has trouble relying upon himself, Will knows that Jack wants something for him, and that this trumps whatever concern for Will's wellbeing that he may or may not have.  Once Will is incarcerated, Hannibal realizes that his feelings for Will overpower his destructively-curious nature (""I wanted to see what would happen"").

You get an idea for a fantastic song.  This is 100% imagination.  Your imagination doesn't take your technical prowess into account.  If you play an instrument or know someone who does, ask them about how they want to be able to play vs how they *can* play.  As a guitarist, you spend tons of time trying to play a solo the way you're hearing it in your head.  This is  just as true for producers.  Right now I'm still working on a song I started in July because I can't seem to get it close enough to how I want it to be and how I know it can and should be.  

Here's the thing, though, and I implore you to keep this in mind from now until forever:  this is something you have direct control over.  You can't guarantee that you'll find an audience, you can't control whether you 'make it', but you *Can* absolutely narrow the gap between what you envision and what you create.  It takes time and effort.  If you won't even make music because of how critical you are of it, you're only shooting yourself in the foot.  Give yourself a chance, man!

First time you got onto a bike, your one goal was not to fall off of it.  Which you probably still did. 

Give yourself a break, man.  I've been where you are;  I stopped making music for two years because of it and it was the darkest period of my life.  You got into this because you enjoyed it.  You have to find that enjoyment and hold onto it and keep it at the forefront of your mind.

2093,summerlungs,1415156499.0,cltb8lo,"I fell in love with this album the first time I heard Hypnotist whilst emerging from a blackout in the backseat of a friend's car.  Of course it's no Bulletin (one of the greatest albums of all time, IMO), but whatever; it's still great even if it's not the fully-realized masterpiece that is its predecessor.  And it's a damned sight better than the very rushed-sounding At War with the Mystics.

Yoshimi also kinda saved my ass to a very real extent;  I was in a very bad way at the time of its release, and the Flaming Lips' whole vibe of unabashed positivity cut with judicious weirdness was something I clung to like drift wood for a good long time.  As well as Rush of Blood to the Head, but that's another story. 

I feel like Yoshimi loses speed in a big way and sputters out over the last two tracks (even though the last track won a grammy, though IMO that was a consolation prize); it doesn't have much of a conclusion.  I think I remember the band acknowledging this by calling it a partial concept album.  

All these years later (12 of them, holy fuck), what I still admire about this album is the extent to which its songs are rooted in old-fashioned good-by-anyone's-definition songwriting.  This album is made for sitting around campfires, doing impromptu renditions with an acoustic guitar and some friends.  The songs are very technically simplistic, and yet somehow all the more potent for it.  Bizarrely, this thing is at heart kind of the perfect folk album.

Now I'm gonna hate on its followup.  I think at War with the Mystics was mostly complete shit; it has a couple songs that were tailor-made for Wayne Coyne certified audience interaction, and a whole bunch of shallow-pool easy listening that tries to hide their impotency beneath Dave Fridmann's production.  

I read someone describe a song off of Mystics as having a Wayne Coyne melody; i.e., a bad one.  It's always stuck with me; there did used to seem to be one hell of a divide between a FLips song like Hypnotist and, say, Mr. Ambulance Driver (as well as the oodles of milquetoast B-sides released around that time).  Much has been made Drozd being responsible for the majority of the music, both in terms of writing as well as playing, and anyways my whole point in relating this is that whoever wrote Bulletin and Yoshimi was either seriously blocked, or mostly absent.  

They brought it back with Embryonic, however, an album that's still my favorite thing they've done.  It's weird; they started out as a noisy, acid-drenched rawk band, took a brief acid-pop Beach Boys detour, and promptly headed back to even weirder, noisier, trippier rawk.

2126,summerlungs,1414859235.0,clq16zk,"1. Ear Fatigue is real, and it happens faster than you think. If you do a six hour marathon mixing session, five of those hours will be spent undoing any good changes you made in the first hour and getting you further from a good mix. 

You will first become aware of this phenomenon when you first listen back to something you spent six hours working on. To your dismay, shock and horror, it will sound so much worse than what you remembered; then you will say The Words: ""What. The. Fuck. Happened?""

Ear fatigue happened. Once ear fatigue sets in, you lose objectivity. You can't tell if the vocals are too loud or too quiet. You can't tell if the kick sounds good or not. And again: it's not obvious when this happens. I'm still working on becoming more aware of it, and I've been doing this since acidpro back before some of you were born. 

Tl;dr: ear fatigue is the name of the bane of a producer's existence. Take breaks. Every 45 min. take at least a fifteen minute break during which you ideally listen to nothing. Some people listen to pink noise. Just don't listen to EDM. 

2. Reference tracks. Loss of objectivity doesn't just occur as a consequence of ear fatigue; there's long-term loss of objectivity that results from over-exposure to a track. When this occurs is anyone's guess. Have you ever said a word over and over again until it loses its meaning? Say ""spoon"" thirty times out loud in a row. Weird, huh? The same thing happens when you spend too long on one track. Many producers advocate the practice of always having two tracks you're currently working on; this way you can switch to something else once you lose the plot with a track. 

Another method to combat the loss of objectivity is to have a reference track. Pick a song that you think is mixed well and is comparable to the one you're working on (same genre). Set its volume to be roughly comparable to the volume of the track you're mixing. listen for how the other song's producer did the mix. Imitate. If you think this is plagiarism, you're a fool. 

3. Mix quietly. This also staves off ear fatigue, but the big thing it can do for you is to aid in identification of what's too loud. Turn a track down to a pretty low volume; right at the point where you can still hear everything. The melodic elements of your track that are loudest/most clear are probably too loud in the mix. As Ari Noah Karp mentioned, this doesn't apply to the percussion unless you can hear something more clearly than the kick. 

4. Headroom. I'm gonna reiterate pegboard nerds here. The goal of mixing is *NOT* loudness. The goal of mixing is to get a track ready to be mastered. Have you ever cooked anything? Pretend you're making soup; this is the stage when you're adjusting seasoning. It is not ready to eat yet. Pull alllll your faders down, bring up the kick so it peaks at -10 (I actually set it to -8, but whatever). Try to keep the master from going too far over. 

5. Save the wizardry for last. Automation is fun. It separates the wheat from the chaff, the men from the boys, the pros from the noobs. But in general I recommend paying no mind to automation until you've got the composition written and the levels where you want them. Automation can be a very deep can of worms; don't delve into it until you're able to devote all your focus to it. 

6. Work with audio. This is a bit subjective in EDM because mixing can often be as important as the composition. Still, though, that's why you save multiple instances of your project. Before you mix, convert all them midi tracks to audio. Why? Because this means the composition stage is over. The notes are right. Bouncing to audio frees up a ton of CPU, and you can also do a lot of fun things with audio files that you can't do with midi. 

Really, this breaks down track creation into clearly delineated stages. The human mind likes this. If your workflow is like this: ""1. Get an idea for a song 2. Flesh out the idea/make sure the track hits right/how's the reverb?/what about stereo imaging?/is the bass line working with the melody or am I using a few too many dissonant intervals that need to be addressed?/should the bridge be longer?/why does my hook sound funny? 3. Ready for mastering!"" You're gonna spend a tonnnn of time at stage 2. Maybe forever. You might die in stage 2. This is better: ""1. Have an idea 2. Flesh out the melodic components of the idea until you've got a definite song structure. 3. Accentuate dynamics with bass + percussion (NOTE: this is how I do it. Lots of people start with the beat and there is nothing wrong with doing so.). 4. Bounce midi to audio. 5. Address reverb and delay 6. Mix (this overlaps with step five a ton for me)"". This way, you know where you're at. 

7. Keep it simple. One thing a lot of new producers have a tendency to do is to make tracks too busy. This is of course less true in certain genres, but for whatever reason noobs gravitate towards Complextro whether they admit it (or are even aware of it) or not. Look-there is more music in the world today than ever before. You can't expect Johnny Blogger to invest any time into your stuff; you need to grab him from note one. Less is more; let the hook be prominent. Let everything be prominent. 

This is a rule that gets broken frequently. As previously mentioned, Complextro exists. Flying Lotus is the antithesis to this rule. My tracks are still pretty busy, and I'm sure I've crossed the line into ""too busy"" more than once. Simplicity is a guideline based on a valuable principle: eliminate the extraneous. Nothing should be in your track that isn't absolutely necessary to what you're going for. Now, this can still absolutely leave you with an 80-track audio file. But make sure those 80 tracks are necessary. 

One of the greatest challenges for an EDM producer is the task of eliminating good ideas. Just because something sounds good doesn't mean it's necessary. Or, something can sound good and still detract from what you're working towards. You might have a bridge that's two bars too long because there's a hihat motif that you think is just absolutely swell and if you cut those two bars you cut the hihat motif. Okay, so hihat stays, and as a result it takes too long to get back to the chorus or main melodic hook. The listener gets bored and in this over-saturated market likely skips to another track. Mission failed. But the hihats appreciate it, right? Fuck no they don't, they're ones and zeros that no one gives a fuck about one way or the other. Get them out of there; Save them for another track. If they're truly indispensable, find a way to incorporate them elsewhere in your track. These are the decisions you must make.
