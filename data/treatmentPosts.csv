1,The fall of Pittsburgh Car Scene...,TechKnowFrog,0,ud580o,pittsburgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/ud580o/the_fall_of_pittsburgh_car_scene/,0,"For anyone in the Pittsburgh car community, you've probably already heard about the owner of Pittsburgh Car Scene grooming underage girls he met while running the PCS car group... Obviously the other car communities and groups are not having it and this is likely going to mark the end of Pittsburgh Car Scene as we currently know it.

This should serve as a reminder to anyone else getting into the car scene or anyone who plays a larger role in any of the car clubs/groups. Grooming children is never OK!
