I have gone as far as to delete them both from SCCM (the host it took over, and the one it's supposed to be using), and just add back the host I need to image as.  It takes over ANOTHER machine's hostname.

Other PXE images go fine, same procedures (task sequence) followed.

I'm just starting my journey (day 5) but I know that unless I think about the future weight loss as something that is happening and not just maybe happening I'll end up losing before I begin. This also includes me wondering about my skin though even though it's early days. I'm 22 6'3 295 m, and I went from 180(which I'm now using as my goal weight) to 295 within 2.5-3 years. I've read that because I got fat so fast that the loose skin will potentially be worse. I'm not going to beat myself up over It, I would take loose skin over being fat any day, but my main question is in what ways can i help minimise this as much as possible starting now. I've heard drinking lots of water is good and I already do that - but is there anything else I can do? Thanks guys",1529182064.0

I started a business 3 years ago, worked 11 hour days every day, and was pregnant for most of the first year. I ate out a lot during this time, being too exhausted to cook when I got home. Not long after I found out baby two was coming. He was a surprise because we were using protection, but I was happy. I didn’t gain a lot with number 2, but it definitely slowed down my weight loss from baby number one who I gained a lot with. I had a history of extreme calorie restriction, which I have overcome, but I think my terrible metabolism from extreme dieting really added to the weight gain when I was pregnant, and afraid of dieting at all because I became very frighted of the idea that I wouldn’t eat enough and hurt my baby. Well, I’ve lost almost 40 lbs, and I’m so happy about that, but now I’m coming to terms with the fact that I won’t look like I did before. Stretch marks, loose skin on my tummy, a weird layer in my hair from hair loss PP, and boobs that just aren’t as perky. I saw a photo of myself from 4 years ago, looking thin, and fit. It’s got me feeling really depressed, and discouraged. No matter how hard I work I’ll never look like that again. I feel like no diet, or lifting will make me feel pretty again.

Here is a list of some of the things he’s done:

Made rude comments about how I don’t look like my pictures on Facebook with a disgusted face when he first met me. 

Constantly makes rude, and sometimes pretty racist remarks about my race, and culture (I’m Latina and my husband is white) 

Goes out of his way to try to correct every single thing I say, and it always comes off very petty, and condescending. 

Makes comments about my parenting, like telling me I’m “impatient” when all I did was ask my daughter to go to her father because she tried to follow me into the bathroom. I wasn’t yelling or anything. 

Made extremely rude comments to my family at my wedding. 

Every time I go to dinner with my husbands family his step dad embarrasses us all by treating all waiters, and staff terribly! Making rude comments, saying a waitresses makeup looked like a raccoon loud enough for her to hear, kept asking why people are standing around. Complaining about EVERYTHING. It’s humiliating. 

Looked at the beautiful wedding ring my husband bought me, said “not bad, but look at what I got your mom.” And constantly putting people down. 

Got insulted when my husband called my daughter Hispanic, and immediately said “she’s human” but constantly brags about his culture, and speaks about his race with pride. Yet I can’t call my daughter Hispanic???

Insinuating my daughter has a disability because she was fussing one night (she’s 2 for Pete’s sake) and has no disabilities. 

Made comments that my daughter will be fat when she grows up because she likes sweets (like every 2 year old does) and she’s very healthy, petite, and eats lots of healthy foods. 

Comments on any jokes or memes I post to let me know that they aren’t accurate, or are “painting with a broad brush.” Totally ignores that they are innocent (and not offensive at all) jokes that have never bothered anyone else. 

I’m at the breaking point. My daughters birthday party is coming up, and I dread that I will see him there, and I’m terrified of how he will treat my family, and what might result from that. At this point we’ve kept our families pretty separate because of his behavior, and my husband has acknowledged that his behavior is embarrassing and wrong, but nothing has been done, and it feels so unfair. I really don’t want him at the party, but I hate the idea of excluding my very sweet mother-in-law. I’m not an overly sensitive person, and I’m pretty polite, but I’m losing my patience, and I don’t know what to do.",1600301624.0

When we do something new I wonder if he saw it in porn. It makes me want to roll up in the blanket and hide myself from him. When he hugs me, kisses me, there they are. It’s worst when he tells me I’m beautiful, because I’ve seen what he thinks is beautiful, and that’s not me. When he tells me that I’m pretty, or sexy I feel the urge to cry. I can’t stop myself from googling them, and staring at them, and hating them, and wanting to be more like them so maybe I wouldn’t feel this way anymore. I feel like there’s this emotional barrier now. I don’t feel connected. I feel replaceable, and boring.

Edit: Just managed to make out that the listed cause of death is “pneumonia” strange for a 3 hour old baby.

Edit 2: i found another death certificate from that area where the same man signed. In this certificate he was listed as the spouse of a 30 year old woman. She has the same last name as the signer from the baby’s death certificate. Her date of death is listed for June 12 1934, not long after the baby. I believe the baby was hers. I’m not sure why the mother’s name wasn’t listed on the death certificate, but their deaths are actually right next to each other in a registry because they were so close together and with the same last name. On the second death certificate I cannot read the cause of death. It is significantly more faded than the babies. Her name was listed as “caramel” but under maiden name it is listed as “Maria” like the baby’s name, but with a different last name. Worth noting that this is a fairly rare name, leading me to believe even more that they are the same people.

I got this PO Box primarily for package deliveries because there is no place where I live that a package can be placed even remotely inconspicuously.  It has to basically be put down on the sidewalk.  Knowing my area, that is guaranteed to be stolen unless I get it immediately after delivery.

PO Box still has value for me because the packages do arrive there, but I would also love to not have to go there almost every single day to see if I got anything.

Worse yet, I have spent a ton of time getting this addressed.  I have done the USPS online chat tech thing twice,  called the USPS help line twice, and spoken to someone at a bigger nearby post office.

The total, including shipping, was $1100.  When the keyboard arrived, he told me that the corner of it had broken off.  It's only a cosmetic issue that didn't affect the functioning of the keyboard, but it's a bad cosmetic issue and for a vintage keyboard it certainly lowers its value.  

My buyer and I decided that the damage lowered the value of the keyboard by $300.  I refunded him that amount and filed a claim.

Today I saw that the claim was denied.  I called and found out that there was an issue with my proof of value.  That's a separate problem that I've figured out.  However, they told me that the buyer needs to take the item to the post office for inspection.  What's more, he needs to leave it there.  Worst of all, if my claim is approved, I was told that *he will not get the item back*.  

The employee I spoke to recommended changing the claim for the full value of the item, refunding him that amount and basically leaving him without a keyboard that's pretty hard to find. Needless to say, he is not going to want to do this.

The only alternative is to get a reputable repair shop to inspect the item and indicate the cost of the repair.  Since the keyboard is pushing 40, however, no one will be willing or able to do the repair.

She only released a couple albums.  At least one is on YouTube but I don’t think they’re on Spotify.  

She was an acclaimed guitarist and played with a prominent french musician whose name also unfortunately escapes me.

One of the big challenges is finding projects that the students will find engaging, but won't prove excessively challenging for beginners.  This is not easy.

-Altering a photo to resemble the style of the Presidential portraits on the backs of American currency, and then replacing photos of said currency with the doctored photos

-Super-imposed photos (using masks to make it appear as if a single student is, say, pushing and catching his or herself)

-Light painting

-Using the pen tool to trace over photo portraits, essentially creating an illustrated portrait

-Scanning hand-drawn illustrations into illustrator and digitizing/coloring them

Where someone finds themselves in a horrifying situation bereft of a villain?  

It got me thinking. The obvious answer would be disaster films; something like Melancholia doesn't have an antagonist per se, unless one would continue the actual planet Melancholia to be such.  But most of these films don't easily qualify as horror, and furthermore, most of them wind up involving villainous characters in some form or another (Aftershock, for instance).

Something like Final Destination almost works, although it portrays fate as a little too malignant and focused.   

The only horror film that comes to mind and is a perfect fit would have to be Lake Mungo, in which [Spoiler](/s "" 'the future' is ultimately the nefarious force, if there is one"")  

I found the question interesting, though.  Horror is certainly capable of existing even without an obvious threat.

I'm managing a small three-computer media lab and am trying to create a standard account setting for the students that organizes all files on the desktop into an archive folder upon startup.  I'm at a loss as to how to do it.  

The 'Login items' option in the users system preferences is mysteriously absent for standard accounts.  I have an applescript desktop cleanup app that works great on the admin account, but I cannot get it to run on the standard account.

166,Why are Horror Films so Rarely Frightening?,summerlungs,1,2o89ii,horror,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/2o89ii/why_are_horror_films_so_rarely_frightening/,23,"This post was inspired by the ""Do you find any of the films in the 'top ___ horror films of all time' lists scary?"" thread.  I'll repost what I posted therein.

I think fear is a very challenging emotion to effectively evoke in film.  And I'm not referring to shock scares...the whole bait-and-switch is very effective and not too difficult to pull off.  But genuine dread, foreboding, anxiety, and real fear?  Not easy to do.  It's sort of the ultimate suspension of disbelief;  it's one thing to get an audience to forget they're watching actors portraying characters.  Actually getting an audience to forget they're sitting safe and sound in a movie theater or in front of a TV/laptop, managing to transcend reality to the extent of evoking such a primal response that we are hard-wired to not experience very often because of just how necessary it is to our survival?  That's the hardest thing to do in cinema.  Love, excitement, arousal, laughter...these are enjoyable emotions.  We want to feel these things.  Movies that attempt to convey such emotions greatly benefit thusly.  Fear can be an enjoyable thing to experience, but it's an indirect kind of enjoyment, almost an after-the-fact kind of enjoyment.  It's usually the kind of thing you can't experience unless you're physically engaged in some kind of activity that simulates or even creates real danger, i.e. a roller coaster or a motorcycle ride.  And still this is closer to 'shock' fear.  Horror movies are so rarely horrifying because of the immense difficulty of the endeavor.

167,"Found (2012) - Maybe even more disturbing than serbian film. Never thought I'd write those words. And yet, this movie is fantastic. Here's why (no spoilers)",summerlungs,47,2njxmz,horror,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/2njxmz/found_2012_maybe_even_more_disturbing_than/,26,"This might have just become my favorite horror movie.  Unlike Serbian Film, I think it's actually a good movie.  It's shocking, but not merely for the sake of shock.  There's nothing wrong with shock for shock's sake, but I've always been a bit miffed at Serbian Film's IMO bullshit deeper meaning posturing.  

Found depicts adolescent hell perfectly.  Specifically white middle class adolescent hell.  There's the abusive, casually-racist father, the good-hearted and likable mom who has nevertheless lost complete control of her family, the older brother who is effectively the worst-case (and yet not at all improbable) scenario outcome of this kind of household, and the younger brother who is completely at the mercy of every facet of his life.  He's absolutely powerless over all of them.  

The gore is...intense.  I haven't seen this kind of thing outside of the French extreme horror cinema (though I'm not well-versed in the Asian uber-gore films).  And it's completely unexpected;  it comes in the form of a film-within-a-film that is torture porn and yet, for the younger brother, so much more sinister and disturbing.  The film does an excellent job of getting the viewer to identify with the younger brother, and the horror and revulsion he feels while watching the film-within-a-film is transferred over to the viewer.  Because of this, the gore affected me to an extent and in a way that I haven't experienced in a long, long time.  

This film manages to make gore shocking again.  Who would've thought such a thing might be possible?  

What makes this film truly remarkable and eminently successful, however, are the extremely well-developed main characters.  Even the abusive racist prick father has a positive side to him that makes it possible to ever-so-slightly like him.  Again, I wouldn't have thought this was possible.  Any other movie would've portrayed the dad as a one-dimensional son-of-a-bitch and had zero problem doing so.  This film makes him human.  I've known men like him, you know?  

The mom is maybe the most tragic character, because she doesn't have the younger brother's adolescent naivete.  She is a grown adult, she isn't vapid or brain dead, and she actually seems like a good mother who genuinely loves her family.  She is mortified at her husband's racism and abuse.  She tries to get her kids to gravitate away from their interest in violence.  And yet she is completely helpless; watched from her perspective, this film is just a slow dawning awareness on her part that she's caught up in a series events she can't do a damn thing about.  

The older brother manages to avoid what could have easily been a fake and schlocky performance depicting a character who dances really damn close to several point-of-no-return cliches.  But again, he underplays the role.  There's a real nigh-paradoxical subtlety to his performance.  It's truly something to see.  

The younger brother is probably the weakest link, actually.  He's not a particularly good actor, and for most of the film he acts numb to basically everything.  It works because everything else about this film suggests his reality quite successfully, but I think he does leave something to be desired.  Admittedly, I'm amazed that any parent permitted their underage son to be in a film like this, and I'm assuming that its creators didn't exactly have a lot of options when it came to casting the role, however.  

The film isn't perfect;  other posts in this sub have mentioned its extremely low budget, and there are several problems with the audio that takes the viewer out of the film at certain points.  They are minor, however.  

The big problem with this film, the one thing that truly sucks, is its soundtrack.  It's inappropriate for the mood of the film, it's jarring, it actively works against what the film is going for...it's horse shit.  They would've been much better off with no soundtrack at all.  But hey-it's low-budget, and the rest of the film is so solid that it overcomes this one big negative.  

As for what makes the film shocking...firstly, there isn't a ton of gore, but the gore that IS shown in the film is gratuitous, graphic, and wonderfully tasteless.  At the risk of repeating myself, the way the film introduces the gore is ingenious.  I hope whoever created this film keeps at it;  he/she/they have a real gift for finding a novel approach to genre tropes that have been ubiquitous for a very, very long time.  

And secondly...you care about the characters, and as the film progresses, there's this kind of all-encompassing thick atmosphere of hopelessness and despair that makes everything that happens extremely impactful.  I thought Eli Roth was the master of making you care about characters before putting them through hell.  But no, Scott Schirmer has him beat.  He broaches taboos that most films won't go near, no matter how extreme they intend to be (hence my Serbian Film comparison), and  they hit you like an unexpected punch to the gut.  This film is like Mr Rogers one day beating the ever-loving shit out of you while simultaneously sporting an erection.  It's the last thing you expect, and holy fuck does it hit hard.  

Amazing.  See this movie.  I'm blown away.  I've seen about forty horror films in the last two or three weeks, and this one beats them all.  ",1417066677.0

I tried to think of a more recent example of a kids horror film and realized I could not.  It would appear that such films have disappeared altogether.  

And by kids, I mean adolescent pre-teenage kids.  Twilight doesn't count, in other words.  Harry Potter is actually probably the closest thing to kids horror that's been released in years, and I mention it only for want of a better example.  

As for actual kids horror, the most recent thing I can remember would have to be Are You Afraid of the Dark?, the old nickelodeon TV series, and even still it's been off the air for years.  

What happened?  Is this indicative of a cultural change in values that now favors protecting children from any and all forms of horror?  I'd argue that this is, in fact, the case.  

Fantastic kids horror films of yore (that are better than almost every PG-13 horror film intended for older audiences, IMO):

-Dark Crystal (I don't care what genre this film was released as, this movie was fucked up)

-Return to Oz (the ultimate loss-of-innocence life-sucks movie starring a very young Fairuza Balk) 

-Labyrinth, to a large extent.  

-The Witches 

-Never-Ending Story 2 (I think this is the one; it's the really depressing sequel in which the kid goes back to the fantasy land of the first film and finds that everything is sad and fucked-up now).

A film like Poltergeist doesn't quite fit; I think it'd get an R rating these days (I'm still kind of amazed it didn't get an R rating back then), and it'd never in a million years have gotten anything less than PG.  

These examples are just off the top of my head.  Anyone else have any good ones?",1416322341.0

It's a fantastic film, one of the best horror films I've seen in some time, but oh my god it's gonna be haunting my thoughts at least until tomorrow.  

It got me thinking about other horror films like this.  Snowtown was a day wrecker to the extent that it pissed me off;  I don't think the film was especially 'good' (competent at best), and it left me feeling a bit emotionally manipulated.  More than I'd like, anyway.  Another classic example, perhaps the ultimate example, would be...you guessed it...Serbian Film.  That movie killed a part of me that I will never ever get back.  That's okay because I didn't like that part of me anyway, but still.  

Other Day Wreckers:  

-Se7en (almost a life wrecker, this one)
-Don't Look Now (definitely a partial life wrecker)
-Leaving Las Vegas (go ahead and tell me this isn't a horror film)

I'm a huge Pixies fan (stylistically different from SY but from the same era).  and I'm a huge fan of Low, whose lead singer/guitarist was inspired to pick up a guitar and tune it to open G as a result of sonic youth.

but I can't get into sonic youth.  I just don't get it.  I've tried.  I've really, really tried.  Their most accessible albums just sound like...vapid noisy-for-its-own-sake post-punk.

And he did a hell of a job; the editing, the use of lighting and cinematography...Anderson has a habit of using a an all pervasive subtext wry humor as a universal didactic; sometimes it's meant to be taken at face value, but sometimes there's a deeper meaning that sneaks up on you.  Every now and then, though the humor disappears entirely and he punches you right in the gut.  Such is the case with this scene; the film isn't bad, but this sequence alone makes it worth viewing.  It's the first time I've had a film remind me of Roeg's Don't Look Now.

I don't think giving up Bautista was some egregious oversight, I thought it made sense not to resign Byrd, Morneau and AJ (though I love the idea of AJ coming back), and in general I don't think calling Nutting cheap is accurate or fair.  Baseball is the hardest sport in which to field a genuine contender of a team; throwing money at the problem doesn't work.  

This could change, however, and it could change very soon.  

At some point, Nutting is going to have to start spending money on this team.  Martin and probably Walker are going to cost a fortune at some point, but I think it's a fortune the Front Office needs to pay.  If I had to pick a single player who has done the most to turn this team around, it's Martin.  He is irreplaceable.  I don't even want to think about the Pirates without him.  Tony Sanchez seems like a good guy, but I'm starting to really wonder if he's ever going to become a starting catcher.  He cannot throw out base runners, and he goes into very lengthy slumps far too frequently.  

I can't accept a strategy of hoping that at some point this team will field enough extremely underpaid future HOFers who haven't yet reached arbitration years to win the world series.  That sounds crazy to me.  

Very soon, the current front office will be making choices that define their legacy.  I really don't want to see this city fall out of love with the Pirates again.",1406415764.0

I've taken it back to the apple store three or four times.  They've wiped the hard drive twice and had me reinstall everything twice.  the problem persist.  

I posted in the apple.com discussion boards and included the console readouts occurring right before the crash.  A guy there said the logic board is faulty, but he has not responded indicating exactly how he made that determination.

I'm curious about others' opinions on what this has to say.

I am currently an EDM producer who started out as I guess an indie rock musician and stayed that way for a very long time.  

Nothing can match the energy of live performance, but I feel like attention to detail is one of the ways an EDM producer can compensate for this to some extent.  In EDM land, I can control every second of a song, and I can make sure it is 100% doing what I want it to. 

Are listeners going to even be aware of the detail? I think so, albeit perhaps not consciously. The way I set myself apart from the vast hoards of so called edm artists is by taking a ton of time on my songs. So long as I am not squelching the song's energy or vibe, I think people listen to my stuff and get the impression that I am serious about what I do.

Even if not, though, my attention to detail is primarily for my own peace of mind. I've spent the better part of a decade releasing music that was met with thunderous indifference. And each time i would listen back to my stuff and hear things I could've made better.

My last three releases have been far more successful than anything I've ever done, and all of them were created with my newfound attention to detail. Even if this wasn't the case, though, I can still rest easy knowing I made the song as good as it could be.",1401479695.0

His assertion that the cream rises to the top, however, has been nagging me.

Doctor P 'made it'.  As a result, given his personal experience, I can understand why he thinks this.  It's a false correlation, however.  Doctor P made it, so his songs are good.  Therefore all good songs (and their creators) will make it.

I used to believe this, but then I grew up.  Now I know that's just not how life works.

Case in point: time of the season.  This song was the zombies' biggest hit, and it didn't become a hit until the band had been broken up for 7 months.  At first it sank like a stone; it was one flop too many for the zombies and they called it a day.

And then, one single radio station dj fell in love with it.  He put it on heavy rotation, and kept it there.  Slowly the song caught on and finally, going on a year after its release, it was a hit.

You might be wondering why I am using this story to prove my point.  After all, the song ended up a hit.

It did.  And if you think this happened because all good songs get noticed, you better also believe in God, because we are talking about a supernatural guiding force.  Look, I'm actually okay with someone believing that there is a Music God who works similarly to karma.  Maybe Doctor P believes this.  But don't say it's a fact of life.  

Time of the Season was initially heard by thousands of listeners who yawned and promptly forgot about it.  What if that one DJ hadn't fallen in love with it?  Would there be another DJ that would've done the same?  And if so, why didn't they champion the song when it was initially released?

Luck is a powerful force.  Doctor P is very lucky.  Talented as well, but sti very lucky.   Van Gogh, on the other hand, was not.  

What's this all mean?  On the upside, if you never 'make it', don't think it means that you just weren't as good as you thought you were.  For whatever that's worth.

On the downside, though, it means that everyone who loves making music and doesn't love promoting it via social media should seriously curb their beliefs that one day they'll receive the recognition they deserve.  That's like factoring a lottery win into your yearly budget.

241,What is the hardest element of a song to mix?,summerlungs,7,25xnm4,edmproduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/25xnm4/what_is_the_hardest_element_of_a_song_to_mix/,18,"I recently spent a ton of time trying to mix an EDM pop song I wrote that used vocoder on the lead vocal line.  Getting the vocoder to fit in the mix while maintaining intelligibility without ear-bleeding high end abrasiveness was profoundly challenging.  On one hand, the frequencies that promote intelligibility are right around the same frequencies that less to unpleasant hissing.  And on the other hand, vocoded vocals have a ton of parameters; it's very hard to determine which ones to begin with.

What element presents the greatest challenge to mix for you?  I know lots of people struggle with low end, but I found low end mixing to actually be pretty straightforward once I understood the principles of low end frequencies and how to make them fit together.

Though it's not found too much in edm, I think guitars are actually very challenging to properly mix.  Mixing them is really counter-intuitive, and something of a magic trick to get right.",1400500260.0

I'm something of a miserable prick, so my list is longer than I'd care to admit.  But off the top of my head-

Black Francis (Frank Black, Pixies) - Bluefinger.  I was detoxing off of heroin and love and it kept me from just saying fuck it forever.  

Beck - Sea Change.  I was using heroin to detox off of love and I actually don't really listen to this album anymore because of those memories.  This album was better than any suicide line, though, at the time.

Radiohead - Hail to the Thief.  Or rather, the songs that would eventually comprise Hail to the Thief.  Same time period.  God, thank you for the gifts of Thom Yorke and Beck.  

Leonard Cohen - I'm Your Man.  This was the album I listened to most frequently at the age where I developed my first chemical imbalance.  Not because of the album, of course, fuck you for even thinking that.  If you are in hell, Leonard Cohen will come visit you and sit with you and sympathize for as long as you want him to.  

Nick Cave - Let Love In.  All his albums, really, but this one in particular helped me live past the time of a certain woman in particular.  Nick Cave isn't afraid to articulate emotional extremes that can at times transcend gender politics.  

There's more (believe me) but that's all for now.  I want to hear your life saving albums. ",1400074741.0

This was not the first thing she said, but it eventually spilled out of her.  I trusted her music opinions moreso than almost anyone (still do), and her saying this very much stopped me in my tracks because I knew she was onto something.

For me, a demo on a DAW is a sketch; it's me just getting down the basic idea.  Sometimes it's just me singing into my voicemail.  There's usually a rudimentary arrangement, but zero attention is paid to mix or clarity; it's all presets as well.  It's my way of getting something down on paper and trying to capture the 'spark'.  My friend is one of the few people I ever show these to.

She was calling attention to a defect in my process.  From demo to final mix, I was losing the 'spark' and spending a lot of time perfecting something in a way that was sucking the life out of it at the same time.

Of course I am talking about something inherently unquantifiable.  I can't explain the how, only the what.

I live in Western Pennsylvania and am involved in raising awareness about addiction, as well as creating resources for families of addicts.  

As you might imagine, I frequently hear people condemning marijuana as a gateway drug.  They speak at length on their vehement opposition to legalization, and their desire to inform adolescents about how dangerous marijuana can be.

I honestly think this is primarily a waste of time, not to mention inaccurate.  I don't want to, and will never, tell a kid not to smoke pot.  People told me not to, and I did.  I can count on one hand the number of people in high school who never smoked once.  

I went on to harder drugs, and am now in recovery.  Almost no one I knew back then did the same.  I have seen marijuana play a part in the lives of the lazy, but I've also seen computers, the internet, and television play a big a part in the lives of the lazy as well.  On the other hand, I have never known anyone who broke into a house to pay for marijuana, got stoned and beat their spouses, or for that matter, ODed and died on it.  If I have kids, I will encourage them to smoke instead of drink. 

Unfortunately for me, I reacted adversely to marijuana.  It did the opposite to me of what it seems to do to others who enjoy it.  I wish this weren't the case, because perhaps if I could have been satisfied with marijuana, I wouldn't have abused drugs that abused me right back.  

I am soon going to be speaking to some of the local leaders in drug awareness programs in the hopes of compelling them to stop focusing on 'the dangers of marijuana'.  For one, like it or not, it will eventually be decriminalized nationwide.  That's inevitable.  And secondly, calling marijuana a gateway drug is a misunderstanding of drug culture.

Marijuana is the first drug almost everyone does.  When I was a teenager, it was much easier to get than even alcohol.  Some people who smoke marijuana will go on to harder drugs and problematic behavior, but marijuana doesn't compel them to do this.  If I go into a bar and pick a fight, I don't think I can blame any of it on the front door to the bar.

 I want to educate people about the dangers of addiction (especially to hard drugs), and how to find a way out of it.  I don't to misinform people about the dangers of pot.  If every junkie currently alive could magically turn into huge potheads, I would be overjoyed.  Because guess what?  Their chances of being alive in a month just went way, way up.

I wan't to be effective.  I don't want to waste my time beating a dead horse.  

Here is a link to the white house's website concerning the dangers of marijuana use.  If anyone would be willing to help give me a few ideas as to how I might go about forming a counterargument, I would really appreciate it.  I have a few ideas myself, but because I don't smoke, I am not as well-versed in defending it as some of you might be.

https://soundcloud.com/summerlungs/the-great-distraction

this song is meant to have very simple repetitive lyrics like one of those old folk songs such as 'shes coming 'round the mountain', but for better or for worse, here they are:

The Great Distraction (title)
I'm in your arms and I don't know who I am
We're making love and I don't know who I am
I bought you breakfast but I don't know who I am
Bringing it to you but I don't know who I am

The great distraction will come for me again
The great distraction will come for me again

I'm in your mouth
dissolving
into less than a memory
into nothing

Please comment on whatever aspect you want to comment on, but I guess I'm looking for basic impressions of upon hearing it for the first time.  

I had two conversations recently in which two different people enouraged me to record more songs consisting of acoustic instruments as opposed to  my DAW, VSTs, synth, etc.  

I almost never start a song in a DAW; I usually get down a basic idea for a verse or chorus, play it for a while, and then import the audio (or transcribe the midi) into Ableton and start messing around with arrangements, seeing out what fits where, how I want to accompany the melody, etc.  I guess this is the most enjoyable part of songwriting for me, but I also understand how it can be problematic for many many reasons.  

I'm also concerned that I'm not channeling emotion into these performances (to the extent that something done on a DAW can be considered a performance anyway)

Anyway, yeah, any feedback is appreciated.
