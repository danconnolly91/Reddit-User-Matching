I was in a restaurant with my family. We all drink our drinks quickly so it was common for us to want a refill before wait staff would come to check up on us.

I saw our waitress a few tables down and our drinks were empty so I raised my hand to get her attention when she looked like she was about to leave that table. 

A little bit about me now. I often have a difficult time remembering common words. They just seem to be on the tip of my tongue but don't come out. I think it's due to having epilepsy but that part isn't the point. 

She turned and when she was about to start coming over, making eye contact with me, I completely panicked a bit realizing I couldn't say the first word. My hand was still up frozen, eyes locked. I tried to talk and all that happened was my fingers snapping trying to talk. 

She immediately looked so upset and I hope my face portrayed the mortification I felt. 

I didn't apologize, just sputtered out the words I could scrounge together to request refills. 

So, waitress, I am so sorry. I hope my tip reflected that.",1602605181.0

So I've been lurking around here for quite some time, but just recently created an account and wanted to ask a question to all you knowledgeable redditors.

What would the ideal current/future state of endpoint management be?

Is it going straight to modern management like Endpoint Manager (Intune)?  
Or would it be using a co-managed configuration (SCCM/Intune)?

I see modern management as being the next big thing, but I feel its still got a ways to go, especially around delivery optimization, asset intelligence, reporting, etc.

So in my roughly 7 years of being an SCCM/Intune admin, I honestly think it's using both.

What are your thoughts?

I'm approaching this from the standpoint of if I were able to start fresh and implement an ideal solution, what would it be? Regardless of what's currently in use today...",1626988640.0

But other hearts in other lands are beating, With hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.  My country’s skies are bluer than the ocean, And sunlight beams on cloverleaf and pine. But other lands have sunlight too, and clover, And skies are everywhere as blue as mine. \*This is my song, O God of all the nations, A song of peace for their land and for mine.  So let us raise this melody together, Beneath the stars that guide us through the night; If we choose love, each storm we’ll learn to weather, Until true peace and harmony we find, This is our song, a hymn we raise together; A dream of peace, uniting humankind.  \*modified from Stone’s original poetry",1646173782.0

166,Bacon with less mess and fuss,coniptionator,55,dqiw3y,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/dqiw3y/bacon_with_less_mess_and_fuss/,24,"Here's a Ketonian life pro tip for cooking bacon. Set your oven temp at 400. Line a cookie sheet pan with parchment paper. Lay out your bacon.  Bake for 30 minutes, checking it at 20 minutes to adjust pieces if needed. No turning needed. Cooking time will vary depending on brand of bacon, thickness etc. Remove bacon from pan when done and allow grease to cool and solidify on the paper and just throw the paper out if you are not keeping it to cook with. Voila!

Notes: 1. No, the paper will not catch fire. 2. Parchment paper tends to be wider than a standard cooking sheet and so you will be actually making a pan within a pan that will hold the fat as it liquefies. 3. Paper is cheaper than foil. 4. The fat will not seep through the paper. 5. My pans can generally fit a whole 1 lb package of bacon but that varies. It will be crowded but will shrink with cooking. Adjusting it midway through cooking should help, especially the end pieces that tend to cook more quickly than the center ones. 6. You can do several pans at once and prep bacon for a whole week. 7. It is SO much easier to clean up, does not have the splatter factor and the bacon smell in the house is not as pronounced (although it is a lovely perfume, isn't it?).

I’m attempting to find a movie I once saw on Netflix around 2009-2011..

I don’t remember a lot of the movie but some of the key things I can remember are:

- Genre: Horror / Psychological
- Company : IFC films ( I don’t think it was an IFC Midnight movie)

Plot points I can remember..

- Main Character : Male
-  Hiking in the mountains on a trip / getaway
- Comes across some bunker built in the side of a mountain
- Some creature / monster occupies the bunker
- Setting of the movie is Germany I think.

-  A scene of PTSD in the movie of the main character in war, jumping on a grenade...then at the end of the movie to be woken up in a hospital by a nurse, the camera pans out to show the main character  missing a leg (I believe).

I’m afraid to give any more details because I don’t want to accidentally blur the lines between multiple movies...which I may have already.

To preface, I will admit that Kya is not perfect on her leash manners. She's going through her rebellious stage as well which isn't helping *but* she has never once pulled to the point I ever felt I would lose control. Not once and she is half my weight. However, she was entirely on the sidewalk with me and didn't even notice the dog until he was within only a couple feet of us.

I have a broken toe right now and am wearing a boot per doctor recommendation due to the trauma that the rest of my foot also incurred. I've finally been able to take my golden retriever, Kya, 9 month intact female on regular walks again. 

Today was a beautiful day so we took a walk around the block and sat outside with her best friend, an 11 year old lab. We only got two houses down on the way home when this medium sized dog came barrelling out of his house and up to us on the sidewalk, snapping and snarling. I tried to put myself between Kya and this dog, screaming, ""Someone get their fucking dog!"" A neighbor was outside doing gardenwork and tried to scream through the open door as well. Of course, Kya thinks this is all play and is jumping, wagging her tail but I was able to keep her behind me most of the time. The dog bit Kya's tail just as the owner called them back in and I saw him gulp down some of her fur before going back inside. (blonde fur is very obvious on a mostly black dog.) I spoke with the neighbor for a moment, just to apologize that I knew it wasn't her dog. The owner didn't come to check on what happened, literally doted on the dog as it walked through the doorway.

This isn't the first time I've had an issue with this dog. This is just the first time it's been Kya and I alone. Every previous time, my partner and I have been together and he's been able to put himself between the dog and us girls. While this hasn't been a terribly regular occurrence (maybe 1-2x a month since she's been 4 months old), this was the final straw. I called the cops and made a report. I work vetmed and feel so terribly guilty but I was *so scared.* The office kept her cool the entire time but her tone considerably changed when I mentioned the house and dog in question. I'm so anxious that I condemned this dog :'( 

If anything good came out of this, its that Kya doesn't seem traumatized and walked with a skip to her step as we left. Thankfully, there was extremely minimal bruising and she was still more than excited to go on a walk today to meet dad at the bus stop. She ran into a stranger dog and, while the slightest bit more cautious, she did very well. I think she was feeding off of my anxiety at that point.

Ok, I'm so sorry for the vent. This has my adrenaline running, even several hours later. This is my first ever dog and she's been such a goddamn angel, I was, and still am, terrified that someone else's negligence could irreversibly traumatize my dog.",1647056336.0

Wasn't sure whether or not to tag this as a vent or not, since it is, but I ultimately was on leave due to burnout.

So, this is my first ""official"" week back from ""leave."" Leave is in quotes because I was only supposed to be working weekends but was still working 4-5 days a week and asked to come in during the week.

She's already run up the stairs and dove into a bath with me. While that previous interaction was super cute and overall welcome (to encourage her own bath time), the water bowl digging is not welcome.

She started with a stainless steel water bowl which we assumed to be the problem so we switched her bowls; her stainless steel bowl is now her food bowl and her white ceramic bowl is her water bowl. She still dug all of the water out! Ok, I tried to rationalize that maybe it was because the bottom of the ceramic said ""good dog"" in cute, black writing. Well, that immediately was proven false when I took her to work with me the other day and she dug in the plain, green ceramic dish!

We give her loads of attention and walks. When this happens, we take her water bowl away for a small period of time before returning it to her... Then she does it again! It seems like she thinks this is some sort of game! 

I've seen sources say that we should ignore when this happens but we have wooden floors. We can't afford for our floors to end up warped and water damaged. A towel underneath is just prime *yoink* material to send the water everywhere. 

She's even dug the cats' water fountain!

At first, they all showed a lot of genuine interest in our puppy but that's definitely been waning now that she's taken it upon herself to chase them. I don't even think she's trying to chase them, per say, more so play but they're not having it. The boys immediately jet for either the stairs or the cat door to the basement while my girl has no qualms standing her ground, hissing and swatting like the previous stray she is.

We keep her on a playpen when we can't keep a close eye on her and try to keep her on a close leash if the cats are around. When she's good and ignores them, she gets treats and praise. 

Thankfully, there have been no behavioral issues from the cats due to this huge change but I would love for my animals to be able to coexist. The cats absolutely have safe spaces such as the basement, our bedroom and guest room. Does anyone have any further recommendations?",1629572101.0

438,I think I want to leave the field,loko-parakeet,26,oua44k,VetTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/oua44k/i_think_i_want_to_leave_the_field/,10,"I apologise if CSR vents aren't allowed. I just don't know where to go.

Every single day, I feel closer and closer to throwing my hands up and walking out. I bend my back over in an attempt to make both clients and staff happy. Yet I'm always getting yelled at for this, that or whatever. 

Today I got yelled at because we had a double cancel at the end of the day and so I asked the last appointment to come in sooner. They asked if they could bring their other cat, also due for vaccines. I said sure, moved both cats up to 7 and 7:20 respectively. Apparently I shouldn't have had the other cat come in even though we had availability? 

A client also cancelled their cat's dental procedure for tomorrow for many reasons. She told me that she didn't have the money quite yet and was also out of town so that she would have to reschedule.  She said that she would call back because, between the family emergency pulling her out of town and a roof issue, she didn't know if she could afford it. She also expressed deep fear about anesthesia after one of her cats died on the table at another clinic a few days prior. I left at around 6pm and got a message from my PM at 8:15 yelling at me because they want to schedule another cat instead now?


Our technicians also expect reception to weigh dogs which is not a problem usually. For a particularly rambunctious dog today who was truthfully going crazy in the lobby over other dogs, I got the best weight I could and got them into a room to calm them down. I told the technicians that they should double check the weight once it's quiet. It was even written on the board where we put the weights that a reweigh should be done. So they managed to get my bad weight but missed the note right underneath. But that's my fault, right?

I'm yelled at by clients for the state of the entire fucking field. Told I don't care about pets that I've personally given so much love to in office because we're booked. My team is constantly complaining to me about the schedule for one reason or another, despite it being a joint effort between my PM and I. I always take into account the days they need off and scheduled the one girl perfectly around her kids' first week at school so that she got her full-time hours, was able to see them off/pick them up and had the weekend off with them. My team has begged for months for us to have double receptionists on Saturdays so I made it happen. Now they're not happy about having to work every other weekend but I'm with them for every double day. 

I take the fall for things that happen when I'm not even in the office. I took a week long vacation for my mental health at the beginning of July and I was constantly texted the entire time about issues that I had no clue about! 

This is just some of it. I deal with this shit every single day and I'm exhausted. I love animals more than anything and they've been the only thing keeping me going in this field. I've been able to help my own and my friends pets with the resources I have available here. I used to love my coworkers and I used to love interacting with clients... 

I apologise for the vent. I understand it'll be triggering for some but... I just needed to vent. I don't even know where I would go if I quit nor what I would want to do.",1627605518.0

I tend to delete my posts here after getting harassed for several weeks by a guy who thinks we're a hate sub so my history is likely mostly lost. (user in question is u/gullibleairport732 in case he harasses anyone else.)

But the gist is that I've known about my partner's addiction for a long time and, while it affected me, I fell into that toxic mentality of ""all men do it, I'm the crazy one."" Well, it cumulated until this past Xmas Eve where we planned to be intimate and I caught him looking at porn to get into the mood... 

Since then, he's been doing really good. He's been clean and our sex life is much better. I rarely check the accountability app anymore because I'm confident he hasn't done anything to cross my boundaries. 

Unfortunately, I'm still not okay. Ever since then, I've found myself drinking most days. Where a couple glasses of wine would knock me on my ass back in November, a whole bottle leaves me dissatisfied now. I was always a social drinker in the past and now I drink alone almost all of the time. 

I'm now trying to quit and I'm definitely experiencing the withdrawals. I hate this but it definitely is nothing like what my partner experienced with porn. I feel sick. My head hurts. 

I hate that he led me down this path. I hate it so much. I'm so proud of him but, fuck, my body is suffering because of the emotional crutch I felt forced to rely on. I hate that I'm blaming him, too, but it's the trigger that lead to this. 

Here's to hoping I can be strong enough to stop drinking or, atleast, change my relationship with alcohol. I apologize that this is semi off-topic but I didn't feel another sub would be as kind or understanding.",1623110687.0

My partner and I are not officially married but consider ourselves so due to our life circumstances. To us, the house we just purchased together is our commitment to one another after 5 years of a generally happy relationship. 

My partner's mom is genuinely a sweet lady but has attachment issues to her kids and genuinely has no personality outside of being a ""mom/twin mom."" (Three kids, one set of twins.)

However, that very house I mentioned earlier is where shit hits the fan. We've been inviting her over more often simply because we're no longer ok the top floor of a 4 story apartment building with no elevator. I want to stop. Everytime she comes over, she brings two huge tote bags; one full of leftovers and the other full of whatever random junk she's pulled from her closets or saw in the store. 

We already had six of her paintings hung up and she proceeded to being another six. She even took down a tin cat I have on my wall that my recently deceased grandmother gave me and replaced it with her own painting! Any spare nails she sees on our walls from the previous owners, she'll hang up her paintings. She has brought us a rug she decided she didn't really like. She will buy $1 flags and yard decorations for our yard without asking. She'll move stuff around on our table. She even bought us $20 worth of cat treats that my cats cannot eat due to health problems as well as my own preference for feeding my pets high quality foods. This was all dollar store junk. She also brought us mostly finished candles because she didn't want to toss them.

I just want my home to be my home. Before moving in, my partner and I agreed that we would no longer accept hand-me-downs unless we explicitly need it but now he won't grow the spine to stand up to his mom. He tries to say that my family gives us stuff but he refuses to see the nuance in it. Everything my family has given us has been stuff we wanted or stuff they bought us brand new specifically for our home (that we picked out ourselves.)

She also keeps calling my girl cat ""he"" despite being corrected for the past 4.5 years I've had her but that's not too important. What is important is how she almost fed my parrot an apple seed without consulting if it was ok; thankfully my partner caught her and stopped what was happening. She was apologetic and seemed genuine but my parrot could have died because she didn't ask if it was ok to feed an unfamiliar animal. 

Aside from the house stuff, she is incredibly clingy. She will text my partner 6x a day about honestly the most meaningless drivel and will then start spamming me if he doesn't answer fast enough. Funnily enough, she sends the exact same messages to his sisters that she does to him. Word for word.

Mostly a rant that I feel awful about because I know she means well and is so incredibly sweet but I feel like I'm drowning in junk. While her paintings are (mostly) pretty, they're not what I wanted for my own home. I don't want my house to end up looking like my partners childhood home.",1620501826.0

My cats had gotten into a fight and I was quickly comforting them in the hallway when I heard him raise his voice during the call...

He still wants to look at porn. He wishes that I would let him ""just a little bit"" because I ""don't acknowledge his fetish enough."" As I stood up and walked away, I overheard him start to say that he understands that he's at fault and this is the consequence but damn. Okay. I rushed away as soon as possible for not only his privacy but my own sanity. I hopped immediately onto the Sims to play my perfect family :(

We were just starting to finally feel okay after several long talks. Our 5 year anniversary was yesterday and it hurt as I struggled getting through the celebrations knowing what I overheard the day before. I can't talk to him about this and I feel so fucking guilty for overhearing anything at all. I try to stay on the other side of the apartment during his sessions because the walls are thin...  

I can't believe he would say that I wasn't addressing his fetish enough. After our big D-Day almost exactly a year ago, I admit that I wanted nothing to do with it. I felt disgusting even thinking about it and would want to vomit seeing any woman who was his type... which is devastating as you can't exactly avoid pregnant women. Still, we worked hard on our relationship for the year and I began to slowly feel comfortable dirty talking about his fetish in bed for him. Things had been going well before he decided to act out for weeks, turning me down everyday so he could jack off to fucking porn.

I would post things like this to offmychest but I've seen people in our position ripped to shreds there. :/ I've attended my first online meeting although I did not really speak much and I have a couple of therapy appointments next week with different professionals to see who I vibe with.

But fuck. I don't even know if he cares about his recovery at all or if it's just to pacify me. Part of me wants to mention this at our weekly check in on Monday but I don't know if I should. I've been telling myself that I didn't hear the conversation, only a tiny snippet so I could be entirely misinterpreting which is likely why I'm not entirely fuming (mostly feeling guilty about overhearing) but it still hurt to hear.",1612679987.0

As the title says, it's been a month since D-Day... Christmas Eve no less. We've installed accountability apps on all devices since and I'm confident that he's not looking but I still can't shake this paranoia. We've had sex three times since then when we were having it every day before this three week binge relapse where he was turning me down to masturbate to pregnant women. 

With that said, the sex didn't feel right. Any intimacy from him at all just revolts me. When I used to sit in the bathroom with him during his morning bath before I went to work, I can no longer do. Even seeing his penis sends me spiraling into all of the images that I've seen. I wish it even ended there because we were cuddling in bed last night and I felt his penis against my ass and just felt so wildly uncomfortable. Multiple times in the past, I've gotten up to go to the bathroom, smoke or even just see my cats... Anything to just escape.

I feel this is the only safe space I can venture into with these thoughts.

My partner and I have been together almost 5 years. He's also a fetish porn addict. He is considerate and kind in almost every way which makes it all the more painful because it's such a drastic contrast. 

He told me about his fetish (pregnant women) a couple of months into dating and I was initially fine with it although I was a little confused about why he was so worried I would be so upset? Our sex life was perfect for the first year but that likely stemmed from the honeymoon phase. I'm his first partner whereas he is my third.

However, about six months into the relationship, my computer had to go in for repairs so he lent me his his laptop. He told me he barely used it since he had a desktop.

None of us are surprised to hear that this was a lie. *insert meme* I found sites upon sites, hours upon hours, days upon days of porn. Time stamps coincided with days he would have been with me earlier that day. What hurt the most was the roleplay. Roleplaying with other women so he could write out his fantasies of fucking a pregnant woman.

I held it in for awhile. I didn't want to say anything as I had snooped. But it felt wrong. I couldn't get the thought of him constantly jacking off to pregnant women out of my head. I would look at my body and wonder why I wasn't attractive enough. The reasonable side of me knows that I am somewhat attractive with my petite, thin body, long dark hair and large green eyes. Half of my guy friends want to fuck me and I wish I didn't know that information.

I confronted him about it after a month of holding it in. He got defensive, assured me it wasn't that bad and threw out the laptop. Allegedly. I never saw it again. During this time, I tried to indulge in his fetish more. I'd dirty talk for him, bundle clothes under my shirt and, ffs, we even bought a fake silicone belly for him.

I don't remember exactly when it started to spiral. I remember a weekend alone where we fucked, I kid you not, 12 times in 2 days. Well, after the 12th, he went to go shower. I waited a couple of minutes before going in to join him and there he was masturbating to pregnant porn. Probably not even 20 mins after he had just cum inside of me.

It got worse from here. My sex drive dwindled because I felt so terribly depressed. I would catch him here and there. He'd yell at me for snooping, I'd yell at him for breaching my trust. The roleplaying thing was the biggest issue for me. That's involving someone else in your sex life. 

At the beginning of this year, we almost broke up. I couldn't handle it anymore. I would walk out and catch him masturbating to porn in our office or in our bedroom several times a week. He never knew though. I'm a quiet walker thanks to growing up in an abusive home. 

He said he would get help and he did. He was seeing a therapist and recently switched to a new one as he felt the old one was dismissive. He started new medications to control his urges although I don't know the prescription names, I don't like to pry in things like that. 

Our sex life started to improve. We were having sex more often. He was complimenting me, touching my body, holding me as we slept... Things felt so good again. Then my depression kicked in (no fault of his own), had a few anxiety attacks due to triggers and got on new medicine. It's safe to say this medicine is working a bit too well because my sex drive is actually higher than it was before.

Then that voice in the back of my mind started whispering again. My gut was agreeing. I started to get turned down for sex more and more. He had switched medicines a couple of months ago so he kept saying it was affecting his libido. Ok, I understand that.. things happen but then he started staying up later and later. 

Last night, he turned me down again. I made a comment about how I started my period and it ruined my plans for the night. His reaction when he told me he wasn't horny just.... It wasn't agreeing with my stomach. It all clicked for me and I was quiet the rest of the night. I tried to hide my despair but he picked up on it through my voice.

So I snooped. I couldn't handle not knowing. He doesn't even know I snooped. I didn't even say goodbye to him yesterday morning when I got up for work. I cried and had a panic attack, washed my face, came home and didn't even greet him. I laid on the couch and cried for hours. He didn't come out of his office to check on me and actually passing through that room to go get something.

After awhile, I asked him if he cared. He said he was giving me space because he thought that's what I wanted. He said he knew from my reaction last night what was on my mind so I asked him point blank if it was bad again.

He said it was.

I started to cry really hard. I really couldn't stop myself. I told him that I'm feeling so insecure because of all of this. I have no confidence and feel like there's no point of even trying to put effort into myself anymore. I cried. I begged for reassurance. I may have raised my voice but I did not intend to. I tried to explain how it felt to want him so badly and to be rejected for pictures and images of pregnant women.

Then it came. The self pity. It immediately turned into ""How do you think I feel? Knowing I have a problem and it's hurting you?"" I kept trying to tell him that I know how it makes him feel, we've talked about it a lot but what about me? I need some reassurance, some comfort. 

Well, he drowned it all out about how I should have calmly approached him weeks ago because he can't do this alone. I honestly wanted to laugh. He is consciously taking actions to hurt me, lying to me and taking extra steps to make sure I don't find out. 

I couldn't find anymore. I ended up comforting him. I took the day off of work and I'm currently in the bath trying not to cry more. I'm feeling so broken and lost. I'm not strong enough for this. I've survived an abusive childhood home, an abusive ex, an eating disorder... but this hits so much differently.

I just checked out how much time he's spent on the one website I know how account for. It was made in 2012 and he's spent over a month of real time looking at that site. Most of it links out of the site too so it's an exponentially higher amount of time. And that's only ONE site. I hate these websites because the vast majority of the pictures posted are CREEPY. Taken from pregnant women's social media and pictures taken of them in public without their consent.

I'm so sorry for the rant but I have nowhere else to go, nowhere else to vent out my thoughts. I'm so down.",1608673826.0
