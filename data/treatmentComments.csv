994,10malesics,1504785708.0,dmoiawj,"BY master Francis clearly 'tis expressed: 
The folks of Papimania are blessed; 
True sleep for them alone it seems was made 
With US the copy only has been laid; 
And by Saint John, if Heav'n my life will spare, 
I'll see this place where sleeping 's free from care. 
E'en better still I find, for naught they do: 
'Tis that employment always I pursue. 
Just add thereto a little honest love, 
And I shall be as easy as a glove. 

ON t'other hand an island may be seen, 
Where all are hated, cursed, and full of spleen. 
We know them by the thinness of their face 
Long sleep is quite excluded from their race. 

SHOULD you, good reader, any person meet, 
With rosy, smiling looks, and cheeks replete, 
The form not clumsy, you may safely say, 
A Papimanian doubtless I survey. 
But if, on t'other side, you chance to view, 
A meagre figure, void of blooming hue, 
With stupid, heavy eye, and gloomy mien 
Conclude at once a Pope-figer, you've seen. 

POPE-FIG 'S the name upon an isle bestowed, 
Where once a fig the silly people showed, 
As like the pope, and due devotion paid:-- 
By folly, blocks have often gods been made! 
These islanders were punished for their crime; 
Naught prospers, Francis tells us, in their clime; 
To Lucifer was giv'n the hateful spot, 
And there his country house he now has got. 
His underlings appear throughout the isle, 
Rude, wretched, poor, mean, sordid, base, and vile; 
With tales, and horns, and claws, if we believe, 
What many say who ought not to deceive. 

ONE day it happened that a cunning clown 
Was by an imp observed, without the town, 
To turn the earth, which seemed to be accurst, 
Since ev'ry trench was painful as the first. 
This youthful devil was a titled lord; 
In manners simple:--naught to be abhorred; 
He might, so ignorant, be duped at ease; 
As yet he'd scarcely ventured to displease: 
Said he, I'd have thee know, I was not born, 
Like clods to labour, dig nor sow the corn; 
A devil thou in me beholdest here, 
Of noble race: to toil I ne'er appear. 

THOU know'st full well, these fields to us belong: 
The islanders, it seems, had acted wrong; 
And, for their crimes, the pope withdrew his cares; 
Our subjects now you live, the law declares; 
And therefore, fellow, I've undoubted right, 
To take the produce of this field, at sight; 
But I am kind, and clearly will decide 
The year concluded, we'll the fruits divided. 
What crop, pray tell me, dost thou mean to sow? 
The clod replied, my lord, what best will grow 
I think is Tousell; grain of hardy fame; 
The imp rejoined, I never heard its name; 
What is it. Tousell, say'st thou?--I agree, 
If good return, 'twill be the same to me; 
Work fellow, work; make haste, the ground prepare;
To dig and delve should be the rabble's care; 
Don't think that I will ever lend a hand, 
Or give the slightest aid to till the land; 
I've told thee I'm a gentleman by birth, 
Designed for ease: not doomed to turn the earth. 
Howe'er I'll now the diff'rent parts allot, 
And thus divide the produce of the plot:-- 
What shall above the heritage arise, 
I'll leave to thee; 'twill very well suffice; 
But what is in the soil shall be my share; 
To this attend, see ev'ry thing is fair. 

THIS beardless corn when ripe, with joy was reaped, 
And then the stubble by the roots was heaped, 
To satisfy the lordly devil's claim, 
Who thought the seed and root were just the same, 
And that the ear and stalk were useless parts, 
Which nothing made if carried to the marts: 
The labourer his produce housed with care; 
The other to the market brought his ware, 
Where ridicule and laughter he received; 
'Twas nothing worth, which much his bosom grieved. 

QUITE mortified, the devil quickly went; 
To seek our clod, and mark his discontent: 
The fellow had discreetly sold the corn, 
In straw, unthrashed, and off the money borne, 
Which he, with ev'ry wily care, concealed; 
The imp was duped, and nothing was revealed. 
Said he, thou rascal?--pretty tricks thou'st played; 
It seems that cheating is thy daily trade; 
But I'm a noble devil of the court, 
Who tricking never knew, save by report. 
What grain dost mean to sow th' ensuing year? 
The labourer replied, I think it clear, 
Instead of grain, 'twill better be to chop, 
And take a carrot, or a turnip crop; 
You then, my lord, will surely plenty find; 
And radishes, if you are so inclined. 

THESE carrots, radishes, and turnips too, 
Said t'other, I am led to think will do; 
My part shall be what 'bove the soil is found: 
Thine, fellow, what remains within the ground; 
No war with thee I'll have, unless constrained, 
And thou hast never yet of me complained. 
I now shall go and try to tempt a nun, 
For I'm disposed to have a little fun. 

THE time arrived again to house the store; 
The labourer collected as before; 
Leaves solely to his lordship were assigned, 
Who sought for those a ready sale to find, 
But through the market ridicule was heard, 
And ev'ry one around his jest preferred:-- 
Pray, Mister Devil, where d'ye grow these greens? 
How treasure up returns from your demesnes? 

ENRAGED at what was said, he hurried back, 
And, on the clown, proposed to make attack, 
Who, full of joy, was laughing with his wife, 
And tasting pleasantly the sweets of life. 
By all the pow'rs of Hell, the demon cried, 
He shall the forfeit pay, I now decide; 
A pretty rascal truly, master Phil: 
Here, pleasures you expect at will, 
Well, well, proceed; gallant it while allowed; 
For present I'll remit what I had vowed; 
A charming lady I'm engaged to meet; 
She's sometimes willing: then again discreet; 
But soon as I, in cuckold's row, have placed 
Her ninny husband, I'll return in haste, 
And then so thoroughly I'll trim you o'er, 
Such wily tricks you'll never practise more; 
We'll see who best can use his claws and nails, 
And from the fields obtain the richest sales. 
Corn, carrots, radishes, or what you will:-- 
Crop as you like, and show your utmost skill 
No stratagems howe'er with culture blend; 
I'll take my portion from the better end; 
Within a week, remember, I'll be here, 
And recollect:--you've every thing to fear. 

AMAZED at what the lordly devil said, 
The clod could naught reply, so great his dread; 
But at the gasconade Perretta smiled, 
Who kept his house and weary hours beguiled, 
A sprightly clever lass, with prying eye, 
Who, when a shepherdess, could more descry, 
Than sheep or lambs she watched upon the plain, 
If other views or points she sought to gain. 
Said she, weep not, I'll undertake at ease, 
To gull this novice-devil as I please; 
He's young and ignorant; has nothing seen; 
Thee; from his rage, I thoroughly will skreen; 
My little finger, if I like can show 
More malice than his head and body know. 

THE day arrived, our labourer, not brave, 
Concealed himself, but not in vault nor cave; 
He plunged within a vase extremely large, 
Where holy-water always was in charge; 
No demon would have thought to find him there, 
So well the clod had chosen his repair; 
In sacred stoles he muffled up his skin, 
And, 'bove the water, only kept his chin; 
There we will leave him, while the priests profound
Repeated Vade retro round and round. 

PERRETTA at the house remained to greet 
The lordly devil whom she hoped to cheat. 
He soon appeared; when with dishevelled hair, 
And flowing tears, as if o'erwhelmed with care, 
She sallied forth, and bitterly complained, 
How oft by Phil she had been scratched and caned; 
Said she, the wretch has used me very ill; 
Of cruelty he has obtained his fill; 
For God's sake try, my lord, to get away: 
Just now I heard the savage fellow say, 
He'd with his claws your lordship tear and slash: 
See, only see, my lord, he made this gash; 
On which she showed:--what you will guess, no doubt, 
And put the demon presently to rout, 
Who crossed himself and trembled with affright: 
He'd never seen nor heard of such a sight, 
Where scratch from claws or nails had so appeared; 
His fears prevailed, and off he quickly steered; 
Perretta left, who, by her friends around, 
Was complimented on her sense profound, 
That could so well the demon's snares defeat; 
The clergy too pronounced her plan discrete.

999,TechKnowFrog,1627043499.0,h68pbjq,"My thoughts exactly.

When management came to me a few weeks back asking what the ideal future state is, especially for M&A, I told them both. I even wrote a 'playbook' explaining how we would go about doing both.

What had me questioning this one of the new leaders that just came onboard basically laughed at it telling our CIO that we need to get rid of the old technology and move towards all modern management at this point.  Keep in mind, this guy comes from a finance background an only has about 3 years in IT as an 'inspirational leader' \*barf\*.

Anyway, your first comment is essentially the world I'm living in today, different requirements across the board, whereas this guy came from a startup that only used Intune and BYOD. Oh yeah, and had 200 employees... C'mon... we have over 40,000 to deal with across 100+ sites.

But, all that doesn't really matter tbh, since I'm actually anticipating a decent offer for a new company soon. I actually asked them in my interview what they felt about SCCM and Intune/Endpoint Manager, and the hiring manager actually said, in a perfect world, use both correctly, which is what we're not doing today.  I loved that answer, and the interview went very well, so here's to hoping I can join their magical fairyland of happiness!

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to provide your feedback. It sounds like you have a good amount of real world experience on this.  Cheers!",SCCM,2,t1_h68ao4b,True

Is this not in complete contrast of the tone or the positivity of what an invitation to a wedding should be framed in?  So, at first glance, it's a freaking hoot. However, if it is truly an invitation to what should be or could be the most important day of an individual's or couple's life, and not just a joke to post on Reddit, several important questions should arise for all of us. If it is indeed a joke: OK it is a hoot for the reasons stated above. If true, the couple should evaluate it, rewind and cancel this shindig of impending sorrow. It is either: 1. truly alcohol and / or drug inspired and therefore a bad, bad decision - not just the invitation but the marriage; 2. the couple truly doesn't realize or fathom the depth of what a marriage or commitment to a life with another flawed person requires and the pronounced humility that it takes for this to be successful; 3. Items 1 and 2 combined.  So, my couple friends, if these somehow apply to you, please do some regret prevention work and just love each other and forego marriage as it will likely not last beyond the foreseeable future.

If it may be your own loneliness, do something different with her. Remember, it may not take much. If you continue what you are doing, you will get the same result. 2+2+2=6 every time. All you may need to do, is change one variable in how you act with her. And if that one way is borne out of kindness, love, consideration or compassion, I bet you will get a different answer on the right side of the equation.

If it were purposely revealed by the husband, it would be a clearly  aggressive attempt at humiliation and degradation. Since it was not initially revealed and was only when she asked, it is passive, hidden and his private little attempt at being hurtful and debasing without being caught. 
2. You will likely begin questioning a lot about his behaviors, motives and become suspicious about a lot of things that you never were before. Your questioning about the toothbrush  seems to be the beginning of this process. And it should be.
3. Your trust in him has been challenged in the most fundamental way, as it should be.  He has a long road in front of him to EARN your trust back, if it can be earned back.
4. You may find it interesting to do a good, deep and thorough dive through his phone and computer. I predict you will find many things about him that you did not know.
5. If the relationship if worth working on, I suggest finding a good, very experienced therapist who SPECIALIZES in couple counseling. Every therapist  can say that they do couples therapy even though their training may have bee ONE family therapy theories course with no  supervised clinical practice as part of their program. 
6. He will likely need therapy as well on an individual basis. And tell him that you have been screwing his best friend forever, so now, perhaps you are even.

Good luck. You will need it.",relationship_advice,0,t3_bz7l6z,False

This week alone, we've euthanized 12 animals, many of whom have been long term patients for my doctor's. Multiple suffering pets have gone home only to pass away within days because either the owner didn't want to say goodbye yet or they didn't believe in euthanasia. Its only Wednesday and it never ends.

To anyone else reading: I want to reiterate the OP saying be kind to your veterinary professionals. Stop telling them they don't care or they're in it for the money when a diagnosis requires treatment. We entered this field because we love animals and we don't make much money for it. A single veterinary technician performs more tasks than a human nurse; they are your pets' anesthesiologist, x-ray technician, phlebotomist, and so much more all rolled into one.

Lunch breaks are something I very heavily want to push. Perhaps it's selfish of me as CSR but I have not had a break in 6 months; any meal I eat is between phone calls. It's not healthy for people to not have a break throughout the day, especially in a field so hectic as ours. 

Having enough employees is another. Call offs, leaving early and the like will unfortunately happen and we need to have a large enough team to cover those! Half of my entire hospital had a reaction from our COVID vaccines where we didn't feel comfortable working so we all stayed home and those call offs crippled the team throughout the day. I still HIGHLY encourage the vaccine but it's NOT feasible for employees to work lightheaded and dizzy, possibly feverish, while working in medicine. One mistake can be life threatening. 

Thankfully, my team recognizes the power of CSR and I wish more hospitals recognized as such, too. Every tech in my team is trained for the front and we only have one doctor who is rough on the front desk but he's a nightmare all around. He actually yelled at me today simply for asking how he wanted things done for his incoming lab reports now that our system had changed and he's only in the office 1/3 of the time...

I PAINFULLY AGREE with 4 days a week!!! I actually didn't notice until you said it but our doctors only work 4 days a week, 10hr shifts. Our techs and CSRs are there way more than the doctors are. I also agree about better employee discounts. I understand some hospitals, like mine, allow for free exams and dentals (without extractions) but I feel that truly isn't enough for the vast majority of people in the field. I have mostly lucked out in that regard as my vet has taken a lot of pity on my parrot due to an accident in the hospital they caused so they now pay for all of my parrots bloodwork but most people don't have that luxury and I certainly don't with my three other cats, including my cat with 2 autoimmune diseases. 

Also agree on PTO but that's something I feel should be standard nationwide for every career so I would actually up what we get due to the circumstances. 

I sadly cannot speak on insurance as my job provides really good insurance for my area, albeit still expensive.

I apologize if this is rambling but I had a glass of wine and I agreed so much with everything you said.

Edit: I also want to add that I think employees should be given PTO following a traumatic incident in the hospital. I rarely experience this on my end but I see techs struggle with this a lot. I believe that people should be allowed to take time off following an event such as a pet dying on the table in their surgery rotation, a pet dying in their arms, etc...

It's never ok for a partner to make another miserable and that's always a res flag. Sorry if that doesn't make the most sense, a glass of wine on an empty stomach is a doozy.",BlatantMisogyny,7,t1_gvr9gu4,False

This same person would likely cry if a woman said that any man under 5'10 isn't a man but instead a butch lesbian.",gatekeeping,16,t3_mxkieb,False

Seriously, part of being in a relationship is listening to one another even if you don't particularly enjoy the topic at hand. My boyfriend can go on and on about certain anime and video games but I still listen to him just as he does for my own anime, video games, makeup, cosplay AND my friend gossip. He loves my friend gossip more than I do simply because he likes to be informed so he doesn't say something accidentally insensitive to one of my friends.",BlatantMisogyny,79,t3_mxnf57,False

Sadly, he stuck around for years until my half siblings (his kids) were old enough to not be poisoned by her brainwashing like she did to my sister and I with our dad. She was the epitome of the Pikachu face meme when my stepdad finally left and began dating another woman. She was cheating on him at the time and couldn't understand why he left her. He's so happy now and is still in my life; he actually walked my sister down the aisle for her wedding and still tells people he has 4 kids.

She's now engaged to a man from Saudi Arabia she met online who is literally my age. My sister and I are convinced he's using her for a green card but the fact that she cheated on my stepdad and got engaged to a man who is her daughter's age is soooo gross.",BestofRedditorUpdates,57,t3_mxlbwt,False

I definitely am experiencing this now that I bought my first house. I never had issues with pests in my previous rentals but my basement was borderline infested with spiders. We've been here about two months now and I haven't seen a spider in weeks thanks to my cats.",Pets,12,t3_mxinif,False
